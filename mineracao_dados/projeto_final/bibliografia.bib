  abstract = {The financial crisis that began in the UnitedStates in 2007 and spread into a deep worldwide recession focused attention on agency costs in leveragedfirms. Particular attention was given to the incentives ofshareholdersin such firms to overinvest (known as the "risk-shifting" problem) or underinvest (known as the "debt-overhang" problem). Besides these problems,the earlierfinancialcrisis of2002 brought to light shareholders' incentives to misrepresent the financial condition of the firm. Interestingly, to date the interactionsbetween these adverse incentives have not been analyzedin either the legal or finance literatures.The aim of this Article is to fill that gap. Its main conclusion is that misrepresentationofthefirm 'sfinancialresultsalleviates the classicagency costs between shareholdersand debt-holders, leading to less overinvestment (less risk-taking)and less underinvestment due to the debt-overhangproblem. In a nutshell, the explanationis that shareholdersin leveragedfirmscan be viewed as holdinga calloption on thefirm 's assets, and misrepresentationpushes the option into the money, leading to better alignment between the interests ofshareholdersandthe interestsof all stakeholdersof thefirm. Our theoretical results shed new light on the causes of the financialcrisis of 2007 and the ensuing slow recovery. The Article also offers policy recommendations.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the relationship between scientific evidence, uncertainty, risk and regulation. Risk has many different meanings. Furthermore, if risk is defined as the likelihood of an event happening multiplied by its impact, subjective perceptions of risk often diverge from the objective assessment. Scientific evidence may be ambiguous. Scientific experts are called upon to assess risks, but there is often uncertainty in their assessment, or disagreement about the magnitude of the risk. The translation of risk assessments into policy is a political judgement that includes consideration of the acceptability of the risk and the costs and benefits of legislation to reduce the risk. These general points are illustrated with reference to three examples: regulation of risk from pesticides, control of bovine tuberculosis and pricing of alcohol as a means to discourage excessive drinking.},

Nearly two decades have passed since the publication of the seminal economic analyses of fiduciary law by Cooter and Freedman (1991), and by Easterbrook and Fischel (1993), which together have come to underpin the prevailing economic, contractarian model of fiduciary law. The economic theory of agency that motivates those papers has come to permeate the literature on law and legal institutions generally. The law-and-economics movement has matured further, developing new tools and refining its understanding of previously applied concepts. The purpose of this essay is to restate the economic theory of fiduciary law in an updated and accessible synthesis.},

	abstract = {This paper offers a critical overview and assessment of North’s work on institutions and economic change, focusing on aspects of his work that are of interest to law and development scholars. The paper consists of four sections. Section 1 examines North’s approach to institutions through his historical work. It discusses his concept of credible commitment and focuses especially on his interpretation of the effect of the Glorious Revolution on property rights and the role he assigns to property rights in bringing about the Industrial Revolution. Section 2 examines North’s theory of institutions, as reflected in his major theoretical books: Institutions, Institutional Change, and Economic Performance (1990); Understanding the Process of Economic Change (2005); and Violence and Social Orders (2009). It focuses on three related features: the pervasive influence of the principles of neoclassical economics; the exclusive focus on an end-point model based on successful Western economies; and the reluctance to account for the role of organizations in the process of change. Section 3 discusses the role of law in North’s theory. Its objective is to clarify whether, in his theory, law is a protagonist in the process of institutional change or subordinate to economic and political processes. The final section concludes and draws together some of the points developed in the paper.},

The second recommends that the student of economic organization be prepared to cross disciplinary boundaries if and as this is needed to preserve veridical contact with the phenomena. The injunction have an active mind is implemented by being curious and asking the question “What is going on here?” The paper concludes with a discussion of operationalization.},

The most sophisticated moral arguments are unlikely to counteract this behavior. We believe that this morally defensive behavior is responsible, in large part, for much undesirable deception in negotiation. Drawing on recent work in the literature of negotiations, we present some practical guidance on how negotiators might build trust, establish common interests, and secure credibility for their statements thereby promoting honesty. We also point out the types of social and institutional arrangements, many of which have become commonplace, that work to promote credibility, trust, and honesty in business dealings. Our approach is offered not only as a specific response to the problem of deception in negotiation, but as one model of how research in business ethics might offer constructive advice to practitioners.},

Besides identifying the methodological principles and the common propositions in its principal works, which deﬁne the theoretical space of the {NEI}, the article try to identify some inadequacies of its classic texts in explaining the historical processes of institutional change, showing, however, as more recent works have tried to turn more convincing the basic interpretative model.

The emphasis is on the new paths opening up, with a focus on two key issues: hybrid arrangements, which may well be the prevailing organization of transactions in developed market economies; and intermediate, ‘meso-institutions’, which likely provide the missing link between the general rules framing socioeconomic activities and the actors operating within these rules. The underlying argument is that whatever happens to the label ‘{NIE}’, this research program will remain with us for a long time ahead.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT} This paper conceives of the market as an institution, and contrasts two theoretical approaches: Institutionalism, with an evolutionary and analytical bias, whose theoretical basis comes from “Old/Original” Institutionalism, and New Institutional Economics, with an analytical, contractual approach, linked to mainstream economics. Both approaches have given relevant contributions, as they consider the importance of institutions for economic performance. The limits of New Institutional Economics are particularly relevant, whose analysis of the operation of markets is centered on the logic of transaction cost economics as a determinant of economic performance. Evolutionary Institutionalism, in turn, sees the market within a broader scope, in which cost economies only partially explains economic performance, but it is not necessarily seen as a determining factor.

            {RESUMO} Este artigo concebe o mercado como uma instituição, contrastando duas abordagens teóricas: os institucionalistas com viés analítico evolucionário, cuja base teórica vem do “velho/original” institucionalismo, e a Nova Economia Institucional, com uma abordagem de viés analítico contratual, vinculada ao mainstream economics. Ambas as abordagens têm dado relevantes contribuições ao considerarem a importância das instituições para o desempenho econômico. Destaca-se um dos limites da abordagem da Nova Economia Institucional, cuja análise do funcionamento dos mercados está centrada na lógica da busca de economia dos custos de transação, como determinante do desempenho econômico. Por sua vez, o institucionalismo evolucionário compreende o mercado em um escopo mais amplo, em que as economias de custos explicam apenas parcialmente o desempenho econômico, não se constituindo, necessariamente, em um fator determinante.},

	abstract = {Why are the ambitions of economic development practitioners and reformers so often disappointed? One answer is that development policymakers and reformers are congenital optimists. Another answer is that good plans are regularly defeated by those who occupy strategic positions. An intermediate answer is that institutions are important, yet are persistently neglected in the planning process. The article takes a bottom-up, microanalytic approach to economic development and reform. It examines the governance of contract, investment, and private ordering through the lens of transaction-cost economizing. And it assesses the efficacy of the de facto (as against the de jure) institutional environment with respect to credible commitments. In effect, institutional economists are cast in the role of archaeologists of economic reform and development—with the of task unpacking the lessons of the past to inform choices and programs for the future.},

It begins by distinguishing four levels of social analysis, with special emphasis on the institutional environment and the institutions of governance.

Applications, including privatization, are briefly discussed.
