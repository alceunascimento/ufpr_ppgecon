Below is a **suggested paper structure** for systematically examining
how **weak contract enforcement** and **option-value-of-breach**
contributed to **speculative dynamics** in the Brazilian real estate
market boom (2010–2015) and the subsequent “crise dos distratos.” This
outline integrates a **microeconomic real-options** framework with
**Minskyan** macro-financial insights. You can adjust sections based on
your paper length or specific requirements (journal guidelines,
conference format, etc.).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Introduction

1.1 **Contextual Background**\
- Briefly introduce Brazil’s 2010–2015 real estate boom, highlighting
off-plan (pre-construction) sales, skyrocketing prices, and eventual
crash.\
- State the core research question: *How did weak enforcement of
pre-sale contracts, functioning as real options for buyers, amplify
speculation and ultimately contribute to systemic risk?*

1.2 **Research Objectives and Scope**\
- Present main objectives: (i) to show how incomplete enforcement shaped
buyer incentives, (ii) to link micro-level option behavior with
macro-level bubble dynamics, (iii) to connect with Minsky’s instability
hypothesis.

1.3 **Contribution**\
- Emphasize novelty: bridging **law & economics** of contract
enforcement, **real-options** micro theory, and **Minskyan** macro
cycles in a single case study.\
- Preview the argument that judicial leniency facilitated a “call
option” on housing, fueling over-investment that ended in mass contract
rescissions (*distratos*).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Literature Review

2.1 **Contract Enforcement and Economic Activity**\
- Summarize the classic position (strong enforcement fosters trust and
commerce) and the contrarian perspective (weak enforcement can spur
speculative contracting).\
- Cite sources on *option-value-of-breach*, *efficient breach*, and how
deposit-based contracts can create a call-like payoff (Goetz & Scott,
1977; Shavell, 1980; Katz, 2004).

2.2 **Real-Options Theory in Real Estate**\
- Review **real-options** scholarship: Dixit & Pindyck (1994) on
investment under uncertainty, applications to property pre-sales (Chan
et al., 2012; Pavlov & Wachter, 2006).\
- Explain how a **deposit** or small penalty effectively caps downside,
creating a speculative incentive.

2.3 **Minsky’s Financial Instability Hypothesis**\
- Outline Minsky’s hedge-speculative-Ponzi taxonomy (Minsky, 1986).\
- Show how “stability begets instability” as investors shift from hedge
to speculative positions when credit is abundant and enforcement is lax.

2.4 **Brazilian Real Estate Literature**\
- Briefly review local or regional studies on the 2010–2015 boom
(reports, working papers, policy reviews).\
- Highlight known aspects: easy credit, surge in new builds, legal
background on presales, *distratos* crisis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Institutional and Legal Context in Brazil

3.1 **Off-Plan Sales and Legal Framework**\
- Explain *promessa de compra e venda* (pre-sale contract) typically
used in Brazil.\
- Reference any relevant legislation (e.g., Brazilian Civil Code or
specific real estate statutes) and how they address buyer default,
deposits, refunds, etc.

3.2 **Judicial Precedents and Enforcement**\
- Detail how, in practice, courts routinely allowed buyers to exit with
minimal penalty (e.g., 10% of the partial installments, or \~2% of the
total contract price).\
- Provide real examples or jurisprudential citations.

3.3 **Banking and Finance Regime**\
- Summarize construction financing, how banks rely on presale contracts
as collateral.\
- Note any peculiarities (e.g., legal priority rules, or the developer’s
legal obligations).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Theoretical Model: Weak Enforcement as a Call Option

4.1 **Baseline Real-Options Model**\
- Present a microeconomic model with uncertain future price $P_1$,
contract price $K$, deposit $D$.\
- Show how buyer’s payoff becomes $\max\{P_1 - K, -D\}$, an effective
call option.

4.2 **Comparative Statics**\
- Vary the deposit $D$. Illustrate how a lower deposit increases
speculative demand.\
- Discuss buyer’s expected utility as a function of probability $q$
(market optimism).

4.3 **Implications for Over-Contracting**\
- In equilibrium, if competition or other forces keep $D$ small, many
buyers join who have no genuine capacity or intention to finish if
prices decline.\
- Link to moral hazard: the buyer is protected by the weak enforcement,
shifting risk to the developer.

4.4 **Extension: Minskyan Layers**\
- Sketch how an extended or repeated model might see “hedge” buyers
replaced by “speculative” (and eventually “Ponzi”) buyers as optimism
grows and deposit requirements remain low.\
- The cycle is fueled by the real-option effect, consistent with
Minsky’s notion that easy credit and stable conditions reduce fear of
default.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Empirical Examination: The 2010–2015 Brazilian Boom

5.1 **Descriptive Statistics**\
- Present data on real estate prices, volume of new projects, typical
deposit rates in presale contracts, and average penalty for *distrato*.\
- Show timeline: how prices soared until \~2014–2015, then began
declining.

5.2 **Evidence of Option Behavior**\
- Cite cases or official data showing how many buyers walked away after
seeing market prices fall.\
- Mention any estimates of how partial refunds left developers
undercapitalized (or forced them to declare bankruptcy).

5.3 **Judicial Outcomes**\
- Summarize the volume of lawsuits for *distratos* from 2015 onward;
relevant court rulings.\
- Emphasize the near-universal rulings favoring buyers.

5.4 **Impact on Developers and Banks**\
- Document the surge in developer bankruptcies, half-finished buildings,
devaluation of collateral.\
- Highlight the system-wide repercussions (unemployment in construction,
NPLs in banking, etc.).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Discussion

6.1 **Synthesizing Micro and Macro Perspectives**\
- Reiterate how the micro-level contract design—where default costs are
limited—allowed a speculative bubble to form (buyer incentives to sign
multiple contracts).\
- Show how Minsky’s instability logic applies: expanding speculation fed
price growth until an external shock triggered massive defaults.

6.2 **Policy and Enforcement Implications**\
- Argue that moderate or strong enforcement might have *prevented
over-contracting*, ensuring only committed buyers participated.\
- Weigh the short-term gains of rapid expansion (boom) against the
long-term costs (bankruptcies, unfinished stock, reduced trust).

6.3 **Limitations and Alternate Explanations**\
- Mention potential confounding factors (overall economy, interest rate
fluctuations, global liquidity environment).\
- Note that not all defaults are strategic; some might be forced
defaults due to economic recession.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Conclusion

7.1 **Key Findings**\
- Summarize how weak contract enforcement functioned like a real option
for buyers, helping fuel the bubble.\
- Minsky’s lens explains how a stable boom turned unstable rapidly as
speculative positions unwound.

7.2 **Theoretical Contributions**\
- Highlight how bridging **law & economics** of contract enforcement
with **real-options** theory and **Minsky** adds to the literature on
speculative bubbles.\
- Emphasize the broader insight: partial enforcement can paradoxically
stimulate market activity but intensify systemic fragility.

7.3 **Practical Recommendations**\
- Suggest reforms: e.g., mandated minimum deposits, clearer legislation
on refunds, or judicial guidelines limiting *distratos*.\
- Argue for balanced enforcement that discourages purely speculative
deals without stifling legitimate market growth.

7.4 **Future Research**\
- Indicate possible cross-country comparisons (India, China) or deeper
econometric testing on how deposit rates correlate with default rates.\
- Propose exploring reputational or relational mechanisms where formal
law is weak.
