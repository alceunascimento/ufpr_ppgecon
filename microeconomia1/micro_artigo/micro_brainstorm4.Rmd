Below is a more advanced yet concise microeconomic modeling approach that treats weak contract enforcement as conferring an **embedded real option** to the buyer. I outline a simple model in the style of **Dixit & Pindyck (1994)** on real options, adapted to a contractual framework.

---

## 1. Basic Setup

Consider a market with a **risk-neutral** buyer and seller. The buyer wants to purchase an asset (e.g., a real estate unit) at time \(t=0\), with delivery (or project completion) at time \(t=1\). The **future price** \(P_1\) of the asset is uncertain and follows some stochastic process (e.g., geometric Brownian motion), but for simplicity, we will assume a discrete distribution:

\[
P_1 = 
\begin{cases}
P_H & \text{with probability } q, \\
P_L & \text{with probability } 1-q,
\end{cases}
\]
where \(P_H > P_L > 0\).

The buyer signs a contract at \(t=0\) with a contractual purchase price \(K\), payable at \(t=1\). The contract requires an **initial deposit** \(D\) at \(t=0\). If the buyer defaults at \(t=1\), they lose the deposit \(D\). Under perfect enforcement, the buyer would also be liable for any **additional damages** (e.g., full expectation damages) if the market price goes below \(K\). But under **incomplete or weak enforcement**, the buyer’s liability is limited—effectively, they can walk away by forfeiting only the deposit \(D\).

---

## 2. Buyer’s Decision

### 2.1 Payoffs Under Weak Enforcement

- **If \(P_1 \ge K\)**: The asset’s market value \(\ge\) the contract price. The buyer **exercises the option** by completing the purchase at \(K\), obtains the asset worth \(P_1\), and has effectively a payoff of \(P_1 - K - D^*\). However, the deposit \(D\) was already paid at \(t=0\). For net present value, assume a risk-free rate of 0 for simplicity; the buyer’s overall payoff at \(t=1\) is \(P_1 - K\).  
- **If \(P_1 < K\)**: The buyer can either complete the purchase and face an immediate *negative payoff* of \(P_1 - K\); or **default**, forfeiting \(D\) (and possibly some minor transaction/penalty cost, but we treat that as part of \(D\)). Under weak enforcement, there is *no additional liability* beyond losing the deposit. Thus the buyer’s payoff if they default is \(-D\) (counting from \(t=0\)), or \(-D^*\) in present value terms at \(t=1\).  

Hence, at \(t=1\), the buyer compares:

1. **Complete**: payoff \(= P_1 - K\).  
2. **Default**: payoff \(= -D\).  

The buyer will choose to complete iff \(P_1 - K \ge -D\) \(\implies\) \(P_1 \ge K - D\). Equivalently, they default if \(P_1 < K - D\).

### 2.2 Embedded Call Option Intuition

Observe that the buyer’s **ex post** payoff from entering the contract at \(t=0\) is:

\[
\Pi_B = 
\begin{cases}
P_1 - K, & \text{if } P_1 \ge K - D, \\
-D, & \text{if } P_1 < K - D.
\end{cases}
\]

Graphically, this is **isomorphic** to a **call option** on the underlying asset \(P_1\) with strike price \(K\), except the payoff is truncated by \(-D\) for the negative states. If \(D\) is small, the buyer’s downside is minimal, while the upside is \((P_1 - K)\). Thus the net cost to the buyer is the deposit \(D\) at \(t=0\), which acts like an **option premium**.

---

## 3. Equilibrium Contract Choice

### 3.1 Ex-Ante Expected Utility of the Buyer

At \(t=0\), the buyer’s expected payoff from entering into the contract is:

\[
\mathbb{E}[\Pi_B] = q \times (P_H - K) \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\{P_H \ge K - D\}} \;+\; (1-q)\times \max\{P_L - K, -D\}.
\]

- If \(P_H \ge K - D\), then the buyer exercises in the high-price state, netting \((P_H - K)\).  
- If \(P_L \ge K - D\), it also pays to complete in the low-price state. Otherwise, the buyer forfeits \(D\).  

### 3.2 Seller’s Problem

The seller requires a contract price \(K\) and deposit \(D\). From the seller’s perspective, the expected revenue includes \(D\) if the buyer defaults, or \(K\) if the buyer completes. In a frictionless competitive market, the seller will set \((K,D)\) to maximize their own expected profit subject to the buyer’s **participation constraint**:

\[
\mathbb{E}[\Pi_B] \ge 0.
\]

However, in a **boom market** with many speculative buyers, sellers might have an incentive to reduce \(D\) to attract more buyers. If the deposit is very low, the buyer’s “option premium” is cheap, enticing more speculative demand.

### 3.3 Corner Solutions and Over-Contracting

Consider a scenario with intense market optimism, where \(q\) (the probability of \(P_H\)) is perceived as high. The buyer’s expected payoff from this embedded call becomes large. They are willing to sign many contracts (or if there are multiple asset units) if each contract is perceived as a cheap option. The equilibrium deposit might be driven down by **competition among sellers**, leading to **over-contracting**:

- *Over-Contracting*: If \(D\) is below the “efficient” level (covering negative states), many buyers will sign contracts purely on the upside. If ex-post the asset ends up in the low-price state, they all default, leaving sellers with worthless claims (beyond the paltry deposit).

---

## 4. Illustrative Numerical Example

Let \(q=0.5\), \(P_H=120\), \(P_L=80\). Suppose the contract price \(K=100\).

1. If \(D=0\) (no deposit), the buyer’s payoff is:
   - \(+20\) in the high state (buy for 100, asset worth 120),
   - \(0\) if they default in the low state (for simplicity, ignoring minor transaction costs).
   - Expected payoff = \(0.5 \times 20 + 0.5 \times 0 = 10\).  

2. If \(D=10\), 
   - In the high state (\(P_1=120\)), buyer completes, payoff = \(120 - 100 = +20\).
   - In the low state (\(P_1=80\)), buyer compares \(80-100=-20\) to \(-10\). They default, payoff = \(-10\).  
   - Expected payoff = \(0.5 \times 20 + 0.5 \times (-10) = 5\).  

With a deposit, the buyer’s payoff is lower, but still positive. If sellers are risk-neutral and set \(K=100\) to recover full cost, but do not adjust deposit sufficiently, *some* buyers would sign multiple contracts.

## 5. Implications

### 5.1 Comparison to Perfect Enforcement

In a **perfect enforcement** setting, if the buyer defaults at \(t=1\), they must pay the difference \(\max\{0,\, K-P_1\}\). This effectively removes the buyer’s default option, forcing them to pay the shortfall. In that case, the payoff to the buyer at \(t=1\) is always \(P_1 - K\), which can be negative. There is **no free put** that caps losses at \(-D\). Hence the buyer’s ex-ante willingness to contract is strictly lower.  

### 5.2 Over-Contracting Equilibrium

When many buyers see a cheap embedded call, demand for the asset surges. Sellers, anticipating that some fraction of buyers will default, may raise \(K\) or require a deposit \(D\). However, if there is a mismatch in information or if competition pushes sellers to keep deposits low, the **market equilibrium** can exhibit **excess** contracting volume. Buyers effectively hold a real option with limited downside. In times of *bubble euphoria*, they might willingly pay small deposits for multiple units (for real estate, this was common in certain pre-sale booms).

### 5.3 Welfare Considerations

From a standard welfare perspective, this kind of contract design can lead to **ex post** inefficiency (mass defaults, incomplete projects, negative externalities) even if **ex ante** it looks beneficial for certain buyers. *Coordination failures* can arise; if every buyer uses the system as a call option, the entire sector might suffer from an eventual oversupply and crash (Allen & Gale, 2000).

## 6. Extensions

1. **Continuous State Model**: Instead of a binary outcome \((P_H, P_L)\), assume \(P_1 \sim \lognormal(\mu,\sigma^2)\). Then the buyer’s payoff becomes \(\max\{P_1 - K, -D\}\), akin to a standard call option with limited downside. Tools from real-option pricing can be applied to value this contract precisely (Dixit & Pindyck, 1994).  
2. **Risk-Averse Agents**: Introducing risk aversion changes deposit sizes and equilibrium contract price \(K\). Buyers might need a bigger “option premium” if they have high risk aversion, or they might be more reluctant to sign multiple speculative contracts (Eeckhoudt et al., 2005).  
3. **Endogenous Enforcement**: The government can raise the cost of default. For instance, they could enforce **specific performance** or require higher damage awards. In equilibrium, this reduces the embedded option value, curtailing speculative demand (Shavell, 1980).  
4. **Repeated Interaction**: If buyers care about **reputation** for future deals, the impetus to default weakens, and the embedded option is less valuable (Klein & Leffler, 1981). Nonetheless, in a large, anonymous market, the reputation mechanism may fail.

### How to Use This Model in a PhD-Level Paper

1. **Set Up the Real-Options Framework**: Introduce the incomplete enforcement concept as effectively granting the buyer a call option on the underlying asset.  
2. **Analyze Equilibrium Effects**: Solve for the deposit \(D\) that sellers would require to break even under certain probabilities of default. Show how ex ante competition or moral hazard can drive \(D\) below a socially efficient level.  
3. **Compare to Perfect Enforcement**: Illustrate how a stronger enforcement regime eliminates or severely reduces the embedded option value, altering the buyer’s willingness to contract.  
4. **Incorporate Empirical Relevance**: Tie back to real-world phenomena (e.g., real estate bubbles) where minimal deposits effectively functioned as cheap call options, leading to large-scale speculation and eventual defaults.
