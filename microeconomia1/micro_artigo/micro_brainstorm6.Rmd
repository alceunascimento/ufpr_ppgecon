Yes, the scenario you describe in the Brazilian real estate market (circa 2010-2015) maps remarkably well onto a **“weak enforcement plus real options”** perspective, supplemented by **Minsky’s financial instability** logic. Below is a more detailed rationale:

### 1. Real-Options Logic in Off-Plan Sales

1. **Off-Plan Contracts:**  
   - Buying an apartment *in planta* (off-plan) involves a construction-period deposit schedule. Buyers pay a fraction of the unit price while the building is underway, with final payments or mortgage settlement upon completion.  
   - In a *strong enforcement* regime, a buyer who reneges after paying some installments would typically lose a large portion of the installments paid or potentially face additional liability. This deters *speculative entry*.  
   - In **weak enforcement** (and especially judicial leniency), however, the buyer can effectively view the contract as a **call option** on the future property price. If prices keep rising, they finalize or flip the unit at a profit. If prices fall, they *distrato*—that is, void the contract with minor forfeiture (~10% of paid installments, which is effectively 2% or so of the total contract sum).  

2. **Expanding the Boom:**  
   - Because buyers’ downside risk was capped at a small deposit forfeiture, they had strong incentives to sign multiple pre-sale contracts. This fueled demand and pushed prices higher, *reinforcing a speculative bubble*.

### 2. Minskyan Perspective: From Hedge to Speculative to Ponzi

1. **Initial Hedge Phase (pre-2010):**  
   - Real estate markets begin stable, developers rely on conventional mortgages, and buyers have moderate leverage or rely on real purchasing power.  

2. **Speculative Phase (2010-2014 peak):**  
   - With cheap credit, rising incomes, and judicial precedents showing leniency for contract rescission, more marginal buyers (some with no real plan to see the purchase through) entered.  
   - This shift parallels Minsky’s notion of *speculative finance*: buyers count on future price appreciation or easy refinancing; if something goes wrong, they rely on cheap exit via the courts.

3. **Ponzi Phase (Late 2014-2015):**  
   - Many participants held multiple off-plan units, *banking purely on flipping at higher prices*. Some “buyers” had no capacity to hold or finance the final purchase if prices stagnated. This is closer to *Ponzi* finance: ongoing need for new buyers or rising prices to keep the scheme afloat.

4. **Crisis Unfolds (2015-2016):**  
   - Economic downturn plus rising interest rates pricked the bubble, prices slumped, and many buyers exercised their “walk-away” option.  
   - *Distratos* soared; courts consistently ruled that developers owed ~90% refunds of whatever buyers had paid, leaving developers severely undercapitalized.  
   - This triggered bankruptcies among builders (*Chapter 11-type restructurings*). Ongoing projects were left unfinished, hurting the remaining “honest” buyers. Banks ended up with devalued collateral and unpaid loans.  
   - Minsky’s final stage—systemic *instability* and partial collapse—manifested as widespread defaults and a glut of unfinished units.

### 3. Why the Real-Options + Weak Enforcement Model Fits Perfectly

- **Weak Enforcement**: Judicial acceptance of *distratos* at a near-full refund rate effectively *signaled* to buyers that the contract was non-binding beyond a trivial penalty.  
- **Cheap Option**: A 10% penalty on interim payments (and often that 10% applied only to the fraction paid in up to a certain point) meant the real cost of default was negligible compared to the unit’s full price.  
- **Over-Contracting**: Many households or speculators jumped in on multiple off-plan deals. Developers saw “strong demand” and kept launching new projects—until reality set in.  
- **Systemic Risk**: As Minsky posits, over-leveraged positions unravel quickly when conditions reverse, leading to bankruptcies and half-built projects. The interlinkage of banks (mortgages, construction finance) exacerbated the systemic shock.

Hence, the “crise dos distratos” is a textbook example of how **incomplete contract enforcement** can inflate a speculative bubble, consistent with the **option-value-of-breach** theory. At the same time, it demonstrates Minsky’s broader argument that *stability begets instability*: a booming sector, easy contract terms, and judicial leniency collectively fostered a wave of speculation, culminating in systemic distress.

## Conclusion

Using a **microeconomic real-options framework** to highlight *how weak enforcement created a cheap exit option*—along with a **Minskyan macro perspective** on shifting from hedge to speculative (and ultimately Ponzi) positions—offers a powerful lens to analyze the Brazilian off-plan real estate boom and ensuing crisis (*crise dos distratos*). It perfectly illustrates both the **theoretical underpinnings** (cheap embedded call option for buyers) and **practical outcomes** (mass defaults, bankruptcies, unfinished projects, and financial instability).
