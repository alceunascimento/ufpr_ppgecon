Excellent. I will conduct a comprehensive literature review on how, in
certain markets---especially speculative or high-risk ones like real
estate pre-sales---weak contract enforcement can paradoxically stimulate
economic activity.

The review will be structured along the six thematic axes you provided,
covering theoretical foundations, behavioral strategies, empirical
evidence, macro-institutional effects, critical counterpoints, and key
references. I will prioritize peer-reviewed sources, working papers from
institutions such as NBER and CEPR, and canonical literature in English.

I'll update you as soon as the full review is ready.

# Theoretical and Conceptual Foundations

Economic theory traditionally holds that strong contract enforcement
underpins market exchange by fostering trust and commitment. However,
some scholars note that when enforcement is only via monetary damages or
is probabilistic, a contract can function like a *call option* for the
promisor ([The Option Element in
Contracting](https://www.virginialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2187.pdf#:~:text=create%20or%20to%20set%20the,mistake%2C%20lack%20of%20capacity%2C%20or)).
Holmes's famous view of contracts (1897) posited that a promisor may
choose either to perform or to breach and pay damages -- essentially
treating the obligation as optional ([The Option Element in
Contracting](https://www.virginialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2187.pdf#:~:text=create%20or%20to%20set%20the,mistake%2C%20lack%20of%20capacity%2C%20or)).
In other words, under lenient enforcement (e.g. expectation damages that
are imperfectly collected), the promisor retains an "option to breach."
Avery Katz (2004) formalized this notion: any contract enforceable
solely by liability "operates in practice as an option" because the
promisor can perform if favorable or default and pay if not ([The Option
Element in
Contracting](https://www.virginialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2187.pdf#:~:text=create%20or%20to%20set%20the,mistake%2C%20lack%20of%20capacity%2C%20or)).
This *option value of breach* becomes especially relevant in
high-uncertainty markets. If parties know they can exit contracts with
limited penalty, their ex-ante willingness to sign contracts may
actually increase, treating the contract as a one-sided bet. Anderson
and Young (2002) develop a model of *imperfect enforcement* illustrating
that stronger enforcement isn't monotonically better for market volume
([Imperfect Contract Enforcement \|
NBER](https://www.nber.org/papers/w8847#:~:text=We%20model%20imperfect%20contract%20enforcement,such%20that%20imperfect%20enforcement%20is)).
In their model, overly strict enforcement locks parties into unfavorable
deals and impedes efficient reallocation, whereas a degree of
enforcement looseness can maximize ex-ante welfare ([Imperfect Contract
Enforcement \|
NBER](https://www.nber.org/papers/w8847#:~:text=under%20improved%20enforcement%20can%20exacerbate,The%20model%20thus%20rationalizes)).
Strikingly, they find multiple equilibria where "anarchy" (no
enforcement) can be locally optimal for trading activity, and perfect
enforcement can be suboptimal ([Imperfect Contract Enforcement \|
NBER](https://www.nber.org/papers/w8847#:~:text=under%20improved%20enforcement%20can%20exacerbate,The%20model%20thus%20rationalizes)).
This insight lays a conceptual foundation for why weak enforcement
might, under certain conditions, *encourage* more contracting by
preserving flexibility.

Asymmetric or selective enforcement regimes further complicate the
incentive structure. If one side of a contract faces milder consequences
for breach than the other, the contract effectively embeds a real option
favoring that party. Civil-law traditions often allow such asymmetry
through *penitential deposits* or **arras** contracts. For example,
Spain's Civil Code (Art. 1454) permits either party to withdraw from a
sale: the buyer forfeits the deposit if they back out, while the seller
must return double the deposit if they back out ([What is an earnest
money contract and what types are there? - Luxton Legal \| Real Estate
Investment
Lawyers](https://www.luxtonlegal.com/what-is-an-earnest-money-contract-and-what-types-are-there/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIf%20earnest%20money%20or%20a,%E2%80%9D)).
This unequal design means buyers' downside is capped (fixed loss of
deposit) whereas sellers' breach is heavily penalized, granting buyers a
valuable option. In Brazil's housing market, jurisprudence evolved to
favor buyers in off-plan sales: courts have ruled developers must refund
70--90% of payments if a buyer walks away ([Microsoft Word - Real Estate
Eng
v4.doc](https://www.realoptions.org/papers2008/Brandao%20Luiz%20-%20Real%20Estate%20Brazil%20V1.pdf#:~:text=that%20developers%20must%20refund%2070,and%20creates%20a%20contingent%20liability)).
Such rulings give buyers an *implicit put option* to abandon with only a
10--30% loss, shifting most risk to developers ([Microsoft Word - Real
Estate Eng
v4.doc](https://www.realoptions.org/papers2008/Brandao%20Luiz%20-%20Real%20Estate%20Brazil%20V1.pdf#:~:text=that%20developers%20must%20refund%2070,and%20creates%20a%20contingent%20liability)).
Theoretically, when buyers are less penalized than sellers, more buyers
will enter contracts in the first place -- even speculatively -- because
they know they can exit at relatively low cost. Meanwhile, sellers,
anticipating some defaults, may raise prices or require deposits, but
cannot fully neutralize the buyer's advantage. This asymmetric
enforcement can thus stimulate transactional volume (many eager buyers)
at the cost of exposing the other side (sellers or lenders) to greater
counterparty risk. Legal scholars note that a regime of one-sided
leniency creates a form of moral hazard: the protected party has an
incentive to "contract now, decide later," effectively treating initial
contracts as tentative.

Beyond formal law, the concept of *real options* has been used to
understand lenient enforcement. If enforcement is uncertain or slow,
contracting parties hold a flexibility akin to an American option --
they can wait and see how market conditions evolve and then decide
whether to fulfill the contract or breach. The value of this implicit
option grows with uncertainty and volatility. Some theorists argue that
in frothy markets like real estate bubbles, a loosely enforced contract
gives the buyer a valuable *option to delay or abandon*. The flip side
is that the seller or creditor holds a shorter stick (an obligation with
limited recourse). In sum, the theoretical lens suggests that under
certain high-risk conditions, the traditional presumption "strong
enforcement =\> more trade" can invert. Lenient enforcement (or
expectation of mild consequences) increases ex-ante willingness to
contract by those who gain the option, essentially because it
reallocates risk and upside/downside in their favor.

# Strategic and Behavioral Mechanisms

When enforcement is weak or uncertain, economic agents may
*strategically exploit* this in their contracting behavior. Models of
strategic default and renegotiation show that rational actors will enter
contracts they would otherwise avoid if they know they can renegotiate
or escape obligations later. For instance, if courts are notoriously
slow or judgments unpredictable, a borrower might take a loan or a buyer
might sign a purchase agreement with the intention to perform only if
conditions remain favorable -- and to default or renegotiate if
conditions turn bad. The contract in such cases resembles a contingent
commitment: a way to **secure a position in a booming market without
full downside risk**. Guseva (2019) describes this as *"contracts as a
form of speculation under uncertain enforcement"*, where parties
consciously treat formal agreements as provisional ([Imperfect Contract
Enforcement \|
NBER](https://www.nber.org/papers/w8847#:~:text=We%20model%20imperfect%20contract%20enforcement,such%20that%20imperfect%20enforcement%20is))
([Imperfect Contract Enforcement \|
NBER](https://www.nber.org/papers/w8847#:~:text=under%20improved%20enforcement%20can%20exacerbate,enforceability%20observable%20in%20survey%20data)).
In real estate pre-sales, for example, buyers often pay a small deposit
to reserve a unit years before completion; if prices rise, they profit
by selling or honoring the contract, but if prices fall, they default
and lose only the deposit. Empirical observations confirm that many
buyers view these contracts as one-way bets. Lai et al. (2004) note that
pre-sale contracts are better modeled as **call options** than as firm
commitments -- the buyer's initial deposit is like an option premium,
granting the right (but not obligation) to purchase at the locked-in
price ([Sale before Completion of Development: Pricing and Strategy \|
Request
PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4995300_Sale_before_Completion_of_Development_Pricing_and_Strategy#:~:text=,))
([Sale before Completion of Development: Pricing and Strategy \| Request
PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4995300_Sale_before_Completion_of_Development_Pricing_and_Strategy#:~:text=appropriate%20to%20model%20these%20contracts,)).
This mindset is a direct exploitation of lenient enforcement: if legal
systems allow easy forfeiture of deposit in lieu of specific
performance, buyers will use the contract to speculate.

Judicial *inefficiency or ambiguity* can be tactically leveraged as a
design feature in contracts. In environments with backlogged courts or
vague standards, parties know that enforcing a breach will be costly and
time-consuming for the counterparty. This expectation can encourage what
economists call *strategic breach*: one party calculates that the other
may prefer to settle or renegotiate rather than litigate to the bitter
end. As a result, the initial contract is not a hard-and-fast rule but
the start of a potential bargaining game. Spulber (2018) argues that
when court enforcement is a "coin-flip" (uncertain outcome), contracts
often include clauses that anticipate renegotiation or allocate
bargaining power in case of non-performance -- effectively treating the
judicial system as an external option to invoke only if private
adjustment fails. In some cases, *judicial ambiguity* (for example,
doctrines that allow judges wide discretion in remedies) might be
intentionally preserved to give parties flexibility. This
counterintuitive idea -- that "inefficient" enforcement can have a
purpose -- is echoed by Rodrik's analysis of second-best institutions.
Rodrik (2008) notes that in many developing countries, firms rely on
relational contracts and informal norms, and a sudden imposition of
strict formal enforcement could **undermine those self-enforcing
arrangements** ([
](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w14050/w14050.pdf#:~:text=Third%2C%20and%20more%20intriguingly%2C%20an,behavior%20in%20relational%20contracts%20is)).
For instance, if businesses are used to the freedom to delay or adjust
contracts informally, making courts iron-clad might reduce their
willingness to contract with less-known partners (because it removes the
expectation of easy exit). Thus, parties may actually prefer a backdrop
of moderate enforcement, using the threat of formal law as a last resort
while otherwise engaging in flexible cooperation.

Behavioral factors also play a role. In bubble markets, widespread
optimism or herd behavior leads individuals to sign contracts that
assume perpetual price rises. Under strong enforcement, the fear of
being on the hook in a downturn might dampen this exuberance. But if
enforcement is weak, *cognitive biases* like overconfidence are
unchecked by legal risk. Agents convince themselves they can always walk
away if things sour, so the usual caution evaporates. This was observed
in the 2000s housing boom: many speculators took out mortgages or
purchase agreements expecting to refinance or flip, implicitly relying
on the ease of default (especially in non-recourse jurisdictions) as a
safety valve. In game-theoretic terms, weak enforcement can turn
contracting into a form of **cheap talk or low-cost signaling** --
buyers signal intent by signing contracts, but that intent lacks
credibility, effectively creating a free option. The result is an
inflation of contract volume relative to truly committed transactions.
Several models (e.g. by ***Huang & Sung, 2006*** in the context of
construction pre-sales) demonstrate that when buyers have a default
option, the equilibrium involves excess demand during booms, as even
marginal buyers join knowing they can abandon. Contracts become
*pseudo-insurance* against missing out on price appreciation -- a "buy
now, decide later" strategy. Importantly, the strategic use of weak
enforcement is self-reinforcing: as more agents behave this way, markets
may become dominated by speculators rather than users, further
encouraging others to join or risk being left out of the gains.

# Empirical Evidence and Sectoral Applications

A growing body of empirical research examines scenarios where weaker
contract enforcement correlates with *higher volumes of contracting*
(contrary to the usual expectation of dampened activity). One prominent
example is in real estate boom-and-bust cycles. **Nam and Oh (2021)**
exploit variation in U.S. mortgage laws to show that states with
non-recourse mortgages -- where lenders cannot pursue borrowers beyond
repossessing the home -- experienced significantly larger housing booms
in the mid-2000s ([Non-recourse mortgage law and housing
speculation](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jbfina/v133y2021ics037842662100248x.html#:~:text=Borrowers%20in%20states%20with%20non,states%20during%20a%20boom%20period)).
In non-recourse states, home prices rose faster and more homes were
bought with high leverage, consistent with speculators being emboldened
by the limited enforcement of debt repayment ([Non-recourse mortgage law
and housing
speculation](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jbfina/v133y2021ics037842662100248x.html#:~:text=Borrowers%20in%20states%20with%20non,states%20during%20a%20boom%20period)).
The authors conclude that the *limited liability* of borrowers (a form
of weak contract enforcement from the lender's perspective)
"encourag[es] speculative investment demands," leading to more highly
leveraged purchases ([Non-recourse mortgage law and housing
speculation](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jbfina/v133y2021ics037842662100248x.html#:~:text=Borrowers%20in%20states%20with%20non,states%20during%20a%20boom%20period)).
This aligns with earlier findings by Pavlov & Wachter (2006) and Ghent &
Kudlyak (2011) that non-recourse or lenient default laws contributed to
U.S. housing price inflation by enabling strategic default behavior.
Similarly, **Buttimer et al. (2008)** and **Chan et al. (2012)**,
studying pre-construction condominium markets, document that buyers
treat deposits as option premiums and will sign purchase contracts in
bulk during upswings, often planning to abandon some contracts if prices
falter. These empirical studies confirm a positive correlation between
lenient enforcement regimes and *the quantity of contracts/loans issued
in boom periods*. Notably, the effect is most visible in speculative
sectors like housing, where assets can swing wildly in value and
contract terms span long horizons.

Cross-country comparisons bolster this argument. In Brazil's early-2010s
real estate boom, an explosion of off-plan apartment sales was
facilitated by lenient enforcement of purchase agreements. Developers
financed projects by pre-selling units, and thousands of buyers signed
contracts often with minimal down-payments. When the economy slowed, a
wave of *"distratos"* (contract rescissions) ensued, as buyers walked
away en masse. Brazilian courts, as mentioned, forced developers to
refund most of what buyers had paid, effectively validating the notion
that those contracts were *non-binding bets* ([Microsoft Word - Real
Estate Eng
v4.doc](https://www.realoptions.org/papers2008/Brandao%20Luiz%20-%20Real%20Estate%20Brazil%20V1.pdf#:~:text=that%20developers%20must%20refund%2070,and%20creates%20a%20contingent%20liability)).
**Rozenbaum et al. (2018)** calculated the option value embedded in
these Brazilian presale contracts, finding it to be "substantial" and a
significant factor in the developer's risk exposure ([Microsoft Word -
Real Estate Eng
v4.doc](https://www.realoptions.org/papers2008/Brandao%20Luiz%20-%20Real%20Estate%20Brazil%20V1.pdf#:~:text=market%20conditions%20become%20unfavorable,out%20of%20the%20sales%20contract))
([Microsoft Word - Real Estate Eng

The presale system's popularity in Brazil (and similarly in parts of
Asia) is thus partly attributable to weak enforcement: buyers know they
can speculate on multiple units with little consequence beyond a small
forfeiture ([Microsoft Word - Real Estate Eng
v4.doc](https://www.realoptions.org/papers2008/Brandao%20Luiz%20-%20Real%20Estate%20Brazil%20V1.pdf#:~:text=market%20conditions%20become%20unfavorable,out%20of%20the%20sales%20contract)).
In India, real estate pre-sales and informal land contracts also
flourished in an environment of patchy enforcement and unclear titles
through the 2000s. Developers would sell units before regulatory
approvals, relying on the fact that by the time disputes arose the
project might be completed or renegotiated. While systematic data from
India are scarcer, anecdotal evidence (e.g. the NCR Delhi housing boom)
indicates that investors entered contracts casually, assuming that
*delay in courts or political intervention* would spare them if the
market turned.

Post-Soviet countries in the 1990s present another angle: despite very
weak formal contract enforcement, entrepreneurial activity did occur via
alternative mechanisms. McMillan and Woodruff (1999) found that in
Vietnam and other transition economies, private firms traded and
contracted at surprising levels by using relational enforcement and
self-help, effectively bypassing the need for strong courts. Some
studies even suggest that in certain Russian regions, the absence of
enforceable formal contracts led to an *increase* in the use of
short-term, high-volume transactions (to avoid long-term commitment
risk). Instead of fewer contracts, there were *more, but transient*
contracts -- deals were continually struck and adjusted in the shadow of
weak law. Frye (2004) observed that when courts are unreliable,
businesses often resort to repeated informal contracts, which can
sustain trade but with different qualities (more reliance on trust and
intermediaries). These findings don't claim weak enforcement is
net-beneficial, but they illustrate that economic actors adapt: rather
than cease contracting, they may engage in *substitute contractual
arrangements* in high numbers (e.g. more handshake deals, more staggered
contracts) to keep business flowing.

Within countries, sectoral evidence shows divergent impacts. In credit
markets, weaker judicial enforcement (e.g. slow foreclosure processes)
generally leads to tighter credit supply -- a negative effect -- except
in speculative credit booms where lenders might relax standards due to
competitive or irrational forces. For instance, **Dell'Ariccia et al.
(2008)** noted that during the U.S. subprime boom, lenders in
jurisdictions with borrower-friendly foreclosure laws still made loans
at a frenetic pace, arguably underpricing the enforcement risk in the
exuberance of the moment. In contrast, manufacturing or export sectors
that rely on long-term contracts usually shrink back in weak enforcement
regions (consistent with orthodox theory). Real estate and construction,
however, seem uniquely prone to *over-contracting under weak
enforcement*. Case studies from Latin America (Brazil, Colombia) and
Asia (China pre-2010s) indicate that pre-sale agreements, futures sales
of commodities, and informal lending proliferate during upswings, with
participants essentially gambling that they won't face full
accountability if the market reverses. These empirical patterns
underscore that the "paradoxical" increase in activity under weak
enforcement is real but context-dependent -- observed chiefly in
speculative arenas where short-term gains are chased and long-term
commitments are malleable.

It is important to note also the role of *informal enforcement* and
"institutional voids" in these outcomes. In environments like India or
post-Soviet states, formal courts might be weak, but informal norms or
extra-legal enforcers (e.g. community enforcement, private arbitration,
even organized crime) step in. This can sustain contracting volume even
when the state's enforcement is feeble. Some scholars (Khanna & Palepu,
2010) refer to this as filling an institutional void -- businesses find
ways to enforce deals via reputation, networks, or upfront collateral.
The result can be a high volume of contracts, but the nature of those
contracts (short-term, revocable, network-dependent) differs from those
under strong rule of law. Thus, empirical evidence must be interpreted
carefully: weak *formal* enforcement might correlate with high
contracting in certain speculative sectors, but often there is an unseen
scaffold of informal guarantees or simply a tolerance for risk that
holds things together, at least temporarily.

# Macroeconomic and Institutional Implications

While weak enforcement can spur a burst of market activity in the short
run, it carries significant macroeconomic implications. One concern is
the fueling of **credit cycles and asset bubbles**. When many agents
engage in contracts with an embedded default option, the economy may
experience an *over-supply of credit and an over-pricing of assets*.
During the boom, this feels like prosperity -- sales are up, new
projects launch, credit flows freely. However, this dynamic also
**amplifies the boom-bust cycle**. Nam and Oh (2021) show that
non-recourse states not only had higher price run-ups but also saw
sharper declines in the bust ([
](http://www1.villanova.edu/dam/villanova/VSB/assets/marc/marc2017/SSRN-id2886111.pdf#:~:text=the%20recent%20crisis%20period%20from,and%20higher%2C%20and%20during%20the))
([
](http://www1.villanova.edu/dam/villanova/VSB/assets/marc/marc2017/SSRN-id2886111.pdf#:~:text=crisis%20decrease%20more%2C%20in%20non,market%20variables%20between%20recourse%20and)).
Essentially, weak enforcement *injected volatility* into the system:
prices swung more, and when the downturn hit, defaults surged, causing
fire sales and credit contraction. This pattern was evident in the U.S.
housing crash of 2008, where states with easier default experienced more
foreclosures and steeper price drops, contributing to systemic risk. The
originate-to-distribute model of mortgage finance further magnified
this, as lenders who didn't bear the ultimate risk had little incentive
to insist on stronger contracts ([Non-recourse mortgage law and housing
speculation](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jbfina/v133y2021ics037842662100248x.html#:~:text=the%20U,states%20during%20a%20boom%20period)).
In a macro sense, allowing contracts that are easily broken can lead to
**excess leverage and misallocation of capital** -- resources flow into
projects that are viable only under perpetual growth assumptions. When
reality deviates, the unwinding of those positions can trigger banking
crises and deep recessions.

Another implication is on **asset pricing**. If investors know that
enforcement is weak, rational pricing would in theory adjust for the
greater default option. For example, loans in weak-enforcement
jurisdictions should carry a risk premium, and asset prices might
actually be lower (since buyers discount the likelihood of
counterparties defaulting). But in speculative episodes, this risk is
often underpriced -- a form of *market failure*. Pavlov & Wachter (2006)
argued that competition among banks during the U.S. housing bubble led
to underpricing default risk in non-recourse loans, effectively
subsidizing borrowers' call options and inflating home prices. Likewise,
developers in Brazil's boom may have overpriced units, assuming not all
buyers would default; when many did, developers and banks were left with
a glut of unsold inventory and non-performing loans. Thus, weak
enforcement can sow the seeds of **financial instability** by
encouraging all parties to take on more risk -- borrowers because they
won't be fully punished, lenders because they misjudge the true risk,
and investors because headline indicators (sales volume, price growth)
look robust until the crash. Hyman Minsky's financial instability
hypothesis -- that stability breeds complacency and risk-taking -- has a
parallel here: lenient enforcement during good times breeds complacency
about contractual risk, leading to a fragile boom.

From an institutional perspective, the long-run effects can be
corrosive. If market participants come to expect that contracts need not
be honored, the **integrity of the legal system and the rule of law**
may erode over time. Frequent breach and non-enforcement can create
*precedents and norms* that make it harder to reverse course later. For
instance, if borrowers en masse default with little consequence, a
culture of non-payment can take hold (as was feared in some emerging
markets after debt crises). This can increase the cost of capital in the
future and deter honest investment. Additionally, weak
enforcement-induced booms often lead to calls for reform when they bust.
Policymakers may respond with abrupt tightening of laws or harsh
crackdowns to restore credibility, which can themselves cause economic
shocks. There is also the issue of **systemic moral hazard**: if agents
believe the legal system or government will bail them out or not enforce
contracts in bad states of the world, it can encourage reckless behavior
(akin to the "too big to fail" problem but at the contract level).

On the other hand, some economists note that in developing economies, a
degree of tolerance for breach can *lubricate commerce* when formal
institutions are underdeveloped. As Rodrik (2008) pointed out, Vietnam
achieved high growth with weak formal courts by relying on relational
enforcement, and efforts to import a Western-style strict contract
regime too quickly could have upset the balance ([
](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w14050/w14050.pdf#:~:text=from%20this%20comparison,judicial%20reform%20may%20well%20be))
([
](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w14050/w14050.pdf#:~:text=relational%20contracting%20in%20Africa%20has,that%20constrains%20Africa%E2%80%99s%20growth%20either)).
In macro terms, this suggests a nuanced view: in some institutional
contexts, *second-best* arrangements (including selective enforcement)
may support growth until more robust legal frameworks can take root.
However, this argument applies more to relational contracting in steady
growth, not to speculative bubbles. In bubbles, the short-term "high" of
activity must be weighed against the **long-term damage** of crashes and
lost trust. The capital misallocation can be severe -- e.g., too many
houses built in Spain's 2000s bubble or too many ghost apartments in
Chinese cities -- resulting in wasted resources that could take years
for the economy to absorb.

In summary, the macro and institutional impacts of weak contract
enforcement are double-edged. In the short run, output and investment
may overshoot as optimistic contracting abounds, potentially boosting
growth and employment temporarily. In the long run, however, this can
translate into **volatile cycles, banking crises, and a drag on
productivity** as misallocated capital and broken contracts have to be
worked out. It can also stall institutional development, as easy exits
reduce the urgency to build more reliable legal enforcement. Thus,
policymakers face a trade-off: enjoy the sugar rush of a boom at the
expense of future stability, or enforce discipline at the cost of a
possibly slower, but more sustainable, growth path.

# Critical Counterpoints and Limitations

Critics of the "weak enforcement can boost activity" thesis highlight
several counterpoints. First, a broad literature in institutional
economics argues that *weak enforcement ultimately suppresses trust and
investment*. Pioneering work by Douglass North (1990) and others showed
that secure property rights and contract enforcement are fundamental to
long-term economic development. In the absence of trust that contracts
will be honored, parties resort to costly safeguards or forgo
transactions altogether. Indeed, many empirical studies find that
regions with poor contract enforcement have *smaller firms, less foreign
investment, and higher transaction costs*. For example, Johnson et al.
(2002) found that in post-communist countries, weak legal enforcement
led entrepreneurs to limit their dealings to a small circle, missing out
on gains from trade with strangers. Weak courts also correlate with
shorter debt maturities and higher interest rates (because lenders fear
default) in cross-country data (Bae & Goyal 2009). These findings
suggest that any short-term spike in contracting under leniency may not
be sustainable -- it could be a bubble-like aberration rather than a
foundation for steady growth.

A key limitation of over-contracting under weak enforcement is
**sustainability of demand**. Once the initial wave of optimistic or
speculative contracts has been signed, the market may quickly saturate,
and the very weakness of enforcement that enabled the boom can
precipitate its end. If buyers start defaulting en masse (exercising
their "options"), sellers and lenders will tighten terms or withdraw,
causing a credit crunch. The temporary demand that was "borrowed" from
the future collapses. In housing, this often manifests as a construction
boom followed by a glut of unsold homes when speculators abandon
purchases. The aftermath can be severe: projects left incomplete, banks
saddled with bad loans, and families losing deposits. The **moral
hazard** aspect means that while individuals might profit by shirking
their commitments, the collective result is harmful. Those who did rely
on the contracts (e.g. a developer counting on pre-sales) suffer losses,
and future participants become wary. In essence, *weak enforcement can
create a boom-bust that ultimately reduces overall welfare*.

Moreover, renegotiation and litigation costs in a weak enforcement
environment can be substantial. When many contracts go into dispute or
require restructuring, legal expenses, court backlogs, and uncertainty
all rise. What seemed like "free exit" at first can turn into protracted
battles over partial repayments or asset recovery. For instance, after
Brazil's presale bust, courts were clogged with cases to adjudicate how
much of the payments must be returned to defaulting buyers ([Microsoft
Word - Real Estate Eng
v4.doc](https://www.realoptions.org/papers2008/Brandao%20Luiz%20-%20Real%20Estate%20Brazil%20V1.pdf#:~:text=consensus%20has%20been%20reached%20that,Filomeno%2C%202003%3B%20Fran%C3%A7a%2C%202003%3B%20Rocha)).
This is inefficient and can take years, delaying economic recovery.
Reputational loss is another factor: parties who repeatedly breach will
find counterparties less willing to deal with them (outside of bubble
contexts). Over time, a culture of breach can degrade the overall credit
culture of a society. Even if the law allows easy outs, businesses may
start demanding *informal guarantees, larger down payments, or risk
premiums* once they've been burned. In other words, the market will
adapt by building in the costs of weak enforcement, potentially negating
the initial volume boost.

There is also the consideration that **not all parties benefit equally**
from weak enforcement. Typically, the more informed or savvy speculators
gain at the expense of less informed players or institutions left
holding the bag. This raises issues of fairness and distribution. For
example, during the U.S. mortgage frenzy, many ordinary homebuyers did
not realize the systemic risk, while more sophisticated actors took
advantage of lax terms and then walked away, leaving neighborhoods
blighted by foreclosures. In developing countries, weak enforcement
might encourage elite insiders to over-borrow and then use political
connections to escape debt -- again a case of private gains and social
losses. These scenarios underscore that while contract leniency can
drive volume, it may undermine **overall trust in the market**. As trust
diminishes, so too will genuine investment and participation, thereby
reversing the initial gains.

Finally, numerous studies underline the long-run benefits of
strengthening enforcement. For instance, a judicial reform in Peru that
expedited contract cases led to increased lending and business entry in
the formal sector (Visaria 2009). In Brazil, when a law was passed in
2018 to limit the refund to defaulting presale buyers (thus making
enforcement stricter than the prior 70--90% refund rule), developers
reported more *serious* buyers and fewer frivolous sales. While initial
contract volumes fell to more realistic levels, the quality and
completion rate of sales improved (anecdotal evidence from Brazilian
Homebuilders Association). Over time, this stability can outweigh the
short-run drop in speculative activity. The fundamental counterpoint is
that **reliable enforcement creates the conditions for sustainable
growth** -- it encourages the development of credit markets, lowers risk
premiums, and allows smaller or outside players to participate without
fear of being cheated. Weak enforcement, conversely, might favor a
transient speculative class and deter long-term players. Thus, the
literature often concludes that any paradoxical boost in activity under
weak enforcement is *limited and potentially illusory*, and that sound
institutions, even if they moderate booms, lead to more balanced
outcomes.

In summary, while weak enforcement can act as a *pressure valve* or even
an accelerant in unique circumstances, it is no panacea. The benefits
are usually short-lived and accompanied by significant caveats: moral
hazard, inefficiency, and loss of confidence. As such, many authors urge
caution in interpreting the evidence -- emphasizing that the goal should
be to harness the positive aspects of flexibility **without**
undermining the rule of law. Achieving this might involve nuanced
approaches like improved bankruptcy laws (that allow orderly exit) or
better-designed contracts (with built-in options), rather than simply
tolerating generally weak enforcement.

Research on contract enforcement and economic activity spans multiple
disciplines. In **institutional economics**, scholars like **Douglass
North** (1990) and **Oliver Williamson** (1985) laid the groundwork on
how institutions (including legal enforcement) affect transaction costs
and development. North stresses the importance of credible enforcement
for complex trade, while Williamson examines private ordering when
public enforcement is costly. **Avner Greif** (1993) provides historical
insight into how merchant guilds used community enforcement to enable
trade in the absence of state enforcement -- relevant to understanding
informal substitutes for weak law. In **law and economics**,
foundational work by **Richard Posner** and **Steven Shavell** explored
efficient breach and the role of remedies. Posner famously viewed
contracts through an economic lens, suggesting that expectation damages
give an incentive for breach only when efficient (echoing the option
concept) ([[PDF] you do have to keep your promises: a disgorgement
theory of
...](https://wmlawreview.org/sites/default/files/Thel-Siegelman.pdf#:~:text=,for%20example%2C%20by%20Charles)).
**Charles Goetz and Robert Scott** (1977) explicitly analyzed liquidated
damages and contracts as options, being among the first to articulate
that a contract with monetary damages "creates an option in the promisor
to breach by paying" -- a seminal idea for this topic. **Avery Katz**
(2004) is a key author who synthesized these notions in *The Option
Element in Contracting* ([The Option Element in
Contracting](https://www.virginialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2187.pdf#:~:text=create%20or%20to%20set%20the,mistake%2C%20lack%20of%20capacity%2C%20or)),
a frequently cited article for the proposition that many contract
doctrines implicitly grant options.

From the perspective of **real estate finance and bubbles**, notable
authors include **Susan Wachter** (e.g., Pavlov & Wachter 2006) who
examined how underpriced default risk led to housing bubbles, **Adam
Levitin** and **Amir Sufi** who have written on the legal frameworks
enabling the subprime boom, and **Peng Liu, Crocker Liu, and Joseph
Gyourko**, who studied pre-sales and speculative behavior in real estate
markets. **Tong-yob Nam and Seungjoon Oh** (Journal of Banking &
Finance, 2021) provide recent empirical evidence on non-recourse laws
and speculation ([Non-recourse mortgage law and housing

(DOI: 10.1016/j.jbankfin.2021.106292). In emerging market contexts,
**Tarun Khanna** and **Krishna Palepu** introduced the concept of
institutional voids and how businesses adapt -- their work (c. 2010)
gives insight into informal contracting in weak legal environments.
**Dani Rodrik** (2008) is an important voice arguing for "second-best
institutions," illustrating with contract enforcement examples that
sometimes unconventional setups can work ([

On the flip side, **Rafael La Porta, Florencio Lopez-de-Silanes, Andrei
Shleifer, and Robert Vishny (LLSV)** (1998, J. Political Economy) are
seminal for linking strong legal enforcement to financial market depth,
a cornerstone of the law-and-finance literature. **Simon Johnson, John
McMillan, and Christopher Woodruff** (2002, J. Law Econ.) produced
influential empirical work on how weak courts limit firm growth in
transition economies, highlighting the costs of weak enforcement.

Specific to real estate pre-sales, **Chi-fai Hui, Kungzhe Tang, and
Charles Ka Yui Lai** (various papers in the 2000s) analyzed the pricing
of presale contracts and the option to default. Lai et al. (2004) in
particular (Pacific Rim Real Estate Society conference paper) modeled
presales as options, a reference point in that niche. In Brazil's
context, **Luiz Brandão** and co-authors (Rozenbaum, Rebello, Fortunato)
have a noted 2018 working paper on the option value in Brazilian presale
contracts ([Microsoft Word - Real Estate Eng
v4.doc](https://www.realoptions.org/papers2008/Brandao%20Luiz%20-%20Real%20Estate%20Brazil%20V1.pdf#:~:text=market%20conditions%20become%20unfavorable,out%20of%20the%20sales%20contract)).
For India's housing market and legal issues, **Vikramaditya Khanna** and
others at NBER/India SSE have discussed how rent control and weak courts
affect housing (e.g., a 2020 CSEP working paper by Kumar et al.
([India's Housing Vacancy Paradox: How rent control and weak contract
enforcement produce unoccupied units and a housing shortage at the same
time -
CSEP](https://csep.org/working-paper/indias-housing-vacancy-paradox/#:~:text=We%20hypothesise%20both%20rent%20control,size%20of%20the%20rental%20market))).
**Alberto Alesina** and **Eliana La Ferrara** (2005) looked at
preferences for enforcement and found cultural differences in tolerance
for default, which complements the behavioral angle. And in contract
theory, **Oliver Hart and John Moore** (though focused on incomplete
contracts rather than enforcement per se) provide the broader context
that when enforcement is imperfect, allocation of control rights matters
-- their work underpins many later models of contracting under
uncertainty.

In conclusion, the literature on this paradox spans from theoretical
(option theory of contracts, efficient breach) to empirical (housing
bubbles, cross-country studies). Key references include: **Anderson &
Young (2002)** (NBER Working Paper 8847) for a formal model where
imperfect enforcement can maximize trade ([Imperfect Contract

cost.
