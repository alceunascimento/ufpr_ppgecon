# Contractual Arrangements and Credit Pools: A Theoretical Literature Review

This literature review examines **contractual arrangements and credit pools** in transactions involving future goods, with an emphasis on theoretical frameworks. It spans foundational mid-20th century works through contemporary advances, focusing on how risk-sharing and credit pooling facilitate sales of assets not yet in existence (e.g. real estate developments, infrastructure projects, industrial output). We organize the review into four key areas: **(1)** Contracts for future goods sales, **(2)** Credit pooling and risk-sharing mechanisms, **(3)** Information asymmetry and incentives in multi-party contracts, and **(4)** Comparative regulatory approaches. Each section highlights relevant economic, financial, and legal theories that shed light on the intertemporal dynamics of such transactions.

## 1. Contractual Arrangements and Future Goods Sales

**Theoretical Foundations – Selling Future Goods:** Transactions for *future goods* (assets to be delivered in the future) rely on contracts to allocate risk and obligations over time. Classic economic theory treats a forward sale as an *executory contract* – a present agreement to exchange in the future. Under contract law, **a purported present sale of future goods is not a transfer of property at contract date, but an agreement to sell upon the goods’ existence or completion ([Sale of Goods Act, 1930 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sale_of_Goods_Act,_1930#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20act%2C%20the,agreement%20to%20sell%20the%20goods))**. This means the buyer and seller’s rights are protected by contract enforcement rather than immediate property rights. Early theoretical work on risk-bearing by Arrow (1964) established that a complete set of forward contracts or contingent claims can optimally allocate risk among parties ([Role of Securities in the Optimal Allocation of Risk-bearing1](https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-abstract/31/2/91/1530613#:~:text=bearing1%20academic,1%20April%201964%2C%20Pages%2091%E2%80%93)). In essence, a contract for future delivery allows the parties to hedge against future price or cost fluctuations, trading off risks in advance.

**Intertemporal Risk Allocation:** A key purpose of selling assets *before* they exist (or are completed) is to redistribute risk between the seller (producer/developer) and the buyer (investor/consumer). **Lai et al. (2004)** model this in a real options framework and find that *presale contracts primarily serve a risk-sharing purpose*: developers can reduce the risk of bankruptcy or unsold inventory by pre-selling units, thereby shifting some market risk to buyers ([Sale before Completion of Development: Pricing and Strategy | Request PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4995300_Sale_before_Completion_of_Development_Pricing_and_Strategy#:~:text=The%20paper%20examines%20the%20risk,nature%20and%20dominated%20by%20large)) ([Sale before Completion of Development: Pricing and Strategy | Request PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4995300_Sale_before_Completion_of_Development_Pricing_and_Strategy#:~:text=,)). For example, in real estate **off-plan sales**, the developer secures a buyer and price upfront, protecting against a future housing market downturn, while the buyer typically pays a lower “presale” price as compensation for taking on project completion risk ([Sale before Completion of Development: Pricing and Strategy | Request PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4995300_Sale_before_Completion_of_Development_Pricing_and_Strategy#:~:text=,)). The buyer locks in ownership and price, which can be valuable if future prices rise, but accepts the risk that the project might be delayed or not delivered as expected. Thus, the contract intertemporally allocates valuation risk: *the developer trades away some future upside (if market prices increase) in exchange for certainty and financing now, whereas the buyer gains price certainty but bears the risk of project failure or price decline* ([The Market for Real Estate Presales: A Theoretical Approach | Request PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228181007_The_Market_for_Real_Estate_Presales_A_Theoretical_Approach#:~:text=a%20presale%20contract,%282004)) ([Sale before Completion of Development: Pricing and Strategy | Request PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4995300_Sale_before_Completion_of_Development_Pricing_and_Strategy#:~:text=,)). Economic theory of forward contracts posits that risk-averse parties can mutually gain by locking in future terms – the developer hedges against price drops and the buyer hedges against price surges or lack of future supply.

**Pre-Sale Financing Models:** Beyond price risk, contractual arrangements for future goods often address financing needs. In industries like real estate and capital projects, **pre-sale contracts serve as a form of **financing**: buyers’ early payments provide interest-free capital to fund construction or production ([The Market for Real Estate Presales: A Theoretical Approach | Request PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228181007_The_Market_for_Real_Estate_Presales_A_Theoretical_Approach#:~:text=,)). This model is common in real estate development (residential *presales*), infrastructure PPPs, and capital goods manufacturing (e.g. aircraft orders). The literature identifies off-plan sales as a mechanism to alleviate developers’ capital constraints and share project risks with buyers ([Microsoft Word - Real Estate Eng v4.doc](https://www.realoptions.org/papers2008/Brandao%20Luiz%20-%20Real%20Estate%20Brazil%20V1.pdf#:~:text=presale,price%20during%20the%20construction%20phase)) ([Microsoft Word - Real Estate Eng v4.doc](https://www.realoptions.org/papers2008/Brandao%20Luiz%20-%20Real%20Estate%20Brazil%20V1.pdf#:~:text=The%20use%20of%20presale%20as,used%2C%20and%20to%20which%20they)). By committing to purchase before completion, the buyer essentially becomes an investor in the project. However, this also means buyers are exposed if the developer defaults or fails to deliver. Theoretical models incorporate this trade-off. For instance, **Edelstein et al. (2012)** present an equilibrium model with risk-averse buyers and show that presales help mitigate *valuation risk* for buyers (locking in a price in an uncertain market), while developers charge a premium for providing this insurance ([The Market for Real Estate Presales: A Theoretical Approach | Request PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228181007_The_Market_for_Real_Estate_Presales_A_Theoretical_Approach#:~:text=a%20presale%20contract,%282004)) ([The Market for Real Estate Presales: A Theoretical Approach | Request PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228181007_The_Market_for_Real_Estate_Presales_A_Theoretical_Approach#:~:text=match%20at%20L561%20substantial%20discount,)). In other words, the buyer pays slightly more (or accepts contract terms) to compensate the developer for taking on future price risk, aligning with the idea that presale contracts bundle a risk-sharing arrangement.

**Contracts as Options and Risk-Sharing:** Recent theoretical work points out that many future goods contracts have option-like features. A presale contract often includes a **deposit and clauses for default**, which create asymmetric rights compared to a simple forward contract. If market conditions change adversely, buyers might forfeit their deposit and walk away (default option), or developers might abandon the project under certain conditions ([Microsoft Word - Real Estate Eng v4.doc](https://www.realoptions.org/papers2008/Brandao%20Luiz%20-%20Real%20Estate%20Brazil%20V1.pdf#:~:text=presale,of%20the%20option%20to%20abandon)) ([Sale before Completion of Development: Pricing and Strategy | Request PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4995300_Sale_before_Completion_of_Development_Pricing_and_Strategy#:~:text=,)). **Lai et al. (2004)** argue that presale agreements can be better viewed as *options* rather than pure forwards because the initial deposit (e.g. 10% of price) is akin to option premium – the buyer can abandon the purchase at cost of losing the deposit ([Sale before Completion of Development: Pricing and Strategy | Request PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4995300_Sale_before_Completion_of_Development_Pricing_and_Strategy#:~:text=,)). This optionality transfers risk: **developers effectively shift a large portion of price risk to homebuyers using presale contracts ([(PDF) Contract rescission in the real estate presale market](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355199199_Contract_rescission_in_the_real_estate_presale_market#:~:text=market%20www,The%20option%20delta))**, since if prices fall or the project’s outlook worsens, buyers may cancel (exercising the “abandon option”) and the developer bears the downside. Conversely, if prices rise, the buyer benefits from the locked-in lower price, meaning the developer forgoes that upside. The contract design (deposit size, penalty clauses) balances these incentives. In summary, theoretical models (real options, game-theoretic models) illustrate that *sales of future goods inherently involve sharing market risk and completion risk* – either party will require compensation (via price discounts, deposits, or premiums) for the risks they assume ([The Market for Real Estate Presales: A Theoretical Approach | Request PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228181007_The_Market_for_Real_Estate_Presales_A_Theoretical_Approach#:~:text=a%20presale%20contract,%282004)) ([Sale before Completion of Development: Pricing and Strategy | Request PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4995300_Sale_before_Completion_of_Development_Pricing_and_Strategy#:~:text=,)).

**Enforcement and Legal Perspectives:** Because delivery is deferred, enforcing future goods contracts is crucial. Law-and-economics research highlights mechanisms to secure performance. For example, *escrow arrangements* and *progress payments* are used to align incentives: many presale contracts stipulate that buyer payments during construction are held in trust or only released upon milestone completion, protecting the buyer’s interest. Likewise, a substantial final payment at delivery (or withholding a portion of the price until completion) creates a **strong disincentive for the developer to default**, since abandoning the project would forfeit the unpaid balance ([Microsoft Word - Real Estate Eng v4.doc](https://www.realoptions.org/papers2008/Brandao%20Luiz%20-%20Real%20Estate%20Brazil%20V1.pdf#:~:text=During%20the%20construction%20phase%20developers,he%20would%20be%20forfeiting%20a)). In some jurisdictions, regulation mandates such arrangements. **Brazil’s real estate law**, for instance, requires developers to file detailed project specifications and often structure payments 50/50 (half during construction, half at completion), which *“reduces the risk to the investor, and the final lump sum payment creates a strong disincentive for the developer to default during construction”* ([Microsoft Word - Real Estate Eng v4.doc](https://www.realoptions.org/papers2008/Brandao%20Luiz%20-%20Real%20Estate%20Brazil%20V1.pdf#:~:text=important%20regional%20differences,receive%20only%20half%20of%20the)) ([Microsoft Word - Real Estate Eng v4.doc](https://www.realoptions.org/papers2008/Brandao%20Luiz%20-%20Real%20Estate%20Brazil%20V1.pdf#:~:text=commercial%20bank,complete%20a%20portion%20of%20the)). If the developer fails to deliver, buyers may have legal rights to refunds or damages. Recent court rulings in Brazil even treat buyer cancellation as an *abandonment option*: developers must refund a large portion (70–90%) of payments if the buyer opts out, imposing a contingent liability on developers and legally *codifying risk-sharing* in the contract ([Microsoft Word - Real Estate Eng v4.doc](https://www.realoptions.org/papers2008/Brandao%20Luiz%20-%20Real%20Estate%20Brazil%20V1.pdf#:~:text=presale,of%20the%20option%20to%20abandon)). From a legal viewpoint, future goods contracts are governed by general contract law and specific statutes (e.g. **Sale of Goods Acts**, condominium and pre-sale regulations) that seek to balance risk. They operate as binding agreements to deliver, with remedies like damages, specific performance, or contract termination clauses available to manage non-performance. In summary, the theoretical and legal foundation of future goods sales emphasizes **allocating risk over time** – through pricing, contract terms, and enforcement measures – so that capital-intensive projects can be financed upfront while mitigating the exposure of each party.

## 2. Credit Pools and Risk Sharing Mechanisms

**Role of Credit Pooling in High-Capital Projects:** Large-scale projects (real estate developments, infrastructure builds, corporate ventures) often exceed the risk capacity of any single investor or lender. **Credit pooling** is a financial strategy where multiple investors or institutions contribute funds to a common project or asset pool, thereby spreading and sharing the risk. The economic rationale is grounded in diversification: by holding a share of a broader portfolio, each participant reduces their exposure to any single asset’s failure. In project finance, for example, it is common to form lending syndicates or consortia of equity investors. *Syndicated loans* allow a lead bank and several other banks to collectively fund a large loan, each assuming a fraction of the credit risk. In simple terms, **syndication is a form of risk sharing that allows financial institutions to enter large transactions** beyond the scale of a single lender’s comfort ([Things to do: ](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/conference/2005/financial_intermed/ivashina.pdf#:~:text=In%20simple%20terms%2C%20syndication%20is,practice%20used%20in%20security%20underwriting)). This practice, with roots in mid-20th century corporate lending and infrastructure finance, enables more efficient geographic and institutional distribution of risk ([[PDF] The syndicated loan market: structure, development and implications](https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt0412g.pdf#:~:text=,originate%20loans%20for%20emerging)). The **BIS** notes that syndicated lending grew because it *“allows banks to share idiosyncratic risks”* of large borrowers across multiple balance sheets ([[PDF] Structure and Pricing of Syndicated Loans](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/conference/2005/financial_intermed/ivashina.pdf#:~:text=,is%20an%20old%20and)). By pooling credit, lenders extend financing to projects that would be too risky individually, thereby improving overall credit access for high-capital needs.

**Structured Finance and Securitization:** A salient modern form of credit pooling is **securitization**, which pools numerous loans or receivables and uses them as collateral to issue securities. The pooled structure redistributes risk from the originator (e.g. a bank or project sponsor) to a broad base of capital market investors. In a typical securitization, an originator (such as a mortgage lender) sells a portfolio of loans to a special purpose vehicle (SPV), which in turn issues **asset-backed securities** to investors ([Back to basics: What Is Securitization? – Finance & Development – September, 2008 – Andreas Jobst ](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2008/09/pdf/basics.pdf#:~:text=In%20step%20one%2C%20a%20company,bearing%20securities%20that)) ([Back to basics: What Is Securitization? – Finance & Development – September, 2008 – Andreas Jobst ](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2008/09/pdf/basics.pdf#:~:text=or%20floating%20rate%20payments%20from,TO%20BASICS%20What%20Is%20Securitization)). Crucially, these structures *slice the pool’s cash flows into tranches* with different risk levels. Senior tranches have first claim on cash flows and thus lower default risk, whereas junior/equity tranches absorb first losses in exchange for higher returns ([Back to basics: What Is Securitization? – Finance & Development – September, 2008 – Andreas Jobst ](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2008/09/pdf/basics.pdf#:~:text=interest%20in%20assets%20Typically%20structured,more%20rating%20agencies%20Reference%20portfolio)) ([Back to basics: What Is Securitization? – Finance & Development – September, 2008 – Andreas Jobst ](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2008/09/pdf/basics.pdf#:~:text=Senior%20tranche,SPV)). **This tranching concentrates default risk in the lower tranches and provides credit enhancement to senior claims**, effectively creating near risk-free securities from a risky asset pool ([Back to basics: What Is Securitization? – Finance & Development – September, 2008 – Andreas Jobst ](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2008/09/pdf/basics.pdf#:~:text=from%20bankruptcy%20of%20seller%20%E2%80%A2,classes%2Ftranches%2C%20rated%20by%20one%20or)) ([The Pooling and Tranching of Securities: A Model of Informed ... - jstor](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3598066#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20as%20the%20intermediary%20grows,free%20debt%20contract)). Indeed, theoretical models by DeMarzo (2005) show that as an intermediary pools more independent loans, it can offer investors almost risk-free senior debt, while retaining or selling junior pieces that bear the pooled risk ([The Pooling and Tranching of Securities: A Model of Informed ... - jstor](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3598066#:~:text=The%20Pooling%20and%20Tranching%20of,free%20debt%20contract)). The pooling thus leverages diversification: if individual asset risks are uncorrelated, the law of large numbers makes the aggregate portfolio’s performance more stable, allowing **risk to be partitioned and allocated** to those willing to bear it (e.g. risk-seeking investors buy junior tranches, risk-averse investors buy senior). 

From a risk-sharing perspective, securitization and other structured finance techniques (like **mortgage-backed securities (MBS)** or **collateralized loan obligations**) enable the transfer of risk to parties best equipped to handle it. Banks and originators reduce their exposure and free up capital by selling loans, while investors gain access to diversified credit investments. **Securitization has historically improved credit access and lowered borrowing costs**, as noted by institutional analyses. According to SIFMA, the ability to pool and sell loans allows lenders to extend *more credit to consumers and businesses, at a lower cost, than would be possible if loans stayed on balance sheet* ([

Empirical studies confirm that wide investor demand for securitized products (e.g. MBS) has lowered mortgage interest rates and broadened availability of credit ([

In essence, **risk is spread across many shoulders**, reducing the likelihood that any single failure derails financing. The downside to this diffusion of risk is potential dilution of accountability (addressed in Section 3), but theoretically, complete markets for credit risk (as envisioned by Arrow-Debreu) should lead to optimal risk allocation.

**Pooled Investment Structures in Practice:** Beyond securitization, other pooled structures include **project finance SPVs**, **infrastructure funds**, and **credit pools for municipalities**. In *project finance*, a stand-alone project company is funded by a coalition of equity sponsors and lenders who agree to specific risk allocations via contracts. The World Bank’s PPP guide highlights that project finance *“permits sponsors to share project risks with other stakeholders,”* distributing risks through a nexus of contracts and guarantees ([5. Project Finance — Benefits and Limitations | The APMG Public-Private Partnerships Certification Program](https://ppp-certification.com/ppp-certification-guide/5-project-finance-%E2%80%94-benefits-and-limitations#:~:text=project%20based%20simply%20on%20the,contractual%20commitments)). For example, construction risk may be passed to a construction contractor (via fixed-price date-certain contracts), revenue risk might be mitigated by offtake agreements (future output purchase contracts), and political risk could be covered by government guarantees or insurance. Each stakeholder assumes the risks they can best manage, consistent with the principle of comparative advantage in risk-bearing. Similarly, **municipal pooled financing** programs bundle small local government loans into a common bond issuance, so that communities with limited borrowing capacity can enjoy the credit risk spread of a larger diversified pool ([[PDF] Bank Liquidity Provision Across the Firm Size Distribution](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27945/revisions/w27945.rev0.pdf#:~:text=,and%20revolving%20credit%20lines)). These structures, some dating back to the mid-20th century in the U.S., show *risk pooling* increasing financing efficiency.

**Effectiveness in Reducing Default Risk:** The efficacy of credit pooling in reducing default risk comes from diversification and *loss mutualization*. By aggregating many independent risks, the probability of catastrophic loss is lowered (assuming risks are not perfectly correlated). Tranching further ensures that most losses are absorbed by a small slice of capital (the junior tranche), protecting senior investors from default except in extreme scenarios. In theory, a well-structured pool can virtually eliminate idiosyncratic default risk for senior stakeholders ([The Pooling and Tranching of Securities: A Model of Informed ... - jstor](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3598066#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20as%20the%20intermediary%20grows,free%20debt%20contract)). However, systemic or correlated risks (e.g. macroeconomic downturns affecting many loans) cannot be eliminated by pooling alone; such risks may still threaten even senior tranches, as the 2008 financial crisis revealed. Empirical studies post-crisis found that certain structured products (like CDOs) were vulnerable because asset correlations were higher than assumed, but plain **diversified pools like prime mortgage securities did show lower default frequencies** than individual loans on average, reflecting genuine risk reduction through pooling. Moreover, research indicates securitized loans can be made safer (lower default probabilities) due to standardized underwriting and external scrutiny – although this is contingent on incentives (see Section 3). **Overall, the literature supports that structured pooling tends to reduce idiosyncratic default risk and increase credit availability**, but it must be paired with incentive-compatible design to truly improve outcomes.

## 3. Information Asymmetry and Incentives in Multi-Party Contracts

Complex transactions involving future goods and pooled credit often entail **multiple parties with asymmetric information and misaligned incentives**. Agency theory and transaction cost economics provide frameworks to analyze these issues. Key problems include moral hazard (parties taking unobserved actions that hurt others) and adverse selection (hidden information leading to low-quality entrants), which can undermine the risk-sharing benefits discussed above.

**Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) and Governance:** Oliver Williamson’s TCE emphasizes that when transactions involve uncertainty and **transaction-specific investments**, parties face the hazard of **opportunism** (self-interest seeking with guile) ([](https://josephmahoney.web.illinois.edu/BA549_Fall%202010/Session%203/Williamson%20(1979).pdf#:~:text=3%20Opportunism%20is%20a%20variety,suffices%20that%20those%20who%20are)) ([](https://josephmahoney.web.illinois.edu/BA549_Fall%202010/Session%203/Williamson%20(1979).pdf#:~:text=4%20The%20joining%20of%20opportunism,factor%20in%20explaining%20decisions%20to)). In a multi-party contract (e.g. a developer, buyers, lenders, and possibly contractors), each party may behave opportunistically if given the chance – a developer might divert funds or skimp on quality after securing presale payments; a buyer might threaten to walk away knowing the developer is financially committed; a lender might withdraw funding at a critical stage. According to Williamson, effective *governance structures are those that attenuate opportunism and infuse confidence in the transaction* ([](https://josephmahoney.web.illinois.edu/BA549_Fall%202010/Session%203/Williamson%20(1979).pdf#:~:text=subgoal%20pursuit,what%20is%20involved%20in%20idiosyncratic)). This may involve creating **hierarchical elements or safeguards** within contracts – for instance, appointing an independent escrow agent or trustee to control funds, or stipulating arbitration mechanisms for disputes. Williamson (1979) notes that absent opportunism, parties could simply rely on complete long-term contracts to adapt over time, but because opportunism exists, extra contractual protections are needed ([](https://josephmahoney.web.illinois.edu/BA549_Fall%202010/Session%203/Williamson%20(1979).pdf#:~:text=though%20it%20bears%20repeating%20that%2C,A%20general)). 

In multi-party deals, one such governance approach is **trilateral arrangement** – involving a third-party guarantor or arbiter to oversee performance ([](https://josephmahoney.web.illinois.edu/BA549_Fall%202010/Session%203/Williamson%20(1979).pdf#:~:text=against%20opportunism%20by%20his%20opposite,The%20two%20types%20of)). For example, in project finance, a common governance feature is a *trustee* (a fiduciary agent) who represents bondholders’ interests, monitors project accounts, and can intervene if covenants are breached. This reduces direct agency conflicts between dispersed investors and the project sponsor. Similarly, **experience rating and reputational bonds** can mitigate opportunism in repeated transactions ([](https://josephmahoney.web.illinois.edu/BA549_Fall%202010/Session%203/Williamson%20(1979).pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L929%20against%20opportunism,for%20parties%20to%20behave%20responsibly)). Reputable developers or sponsors have incentives to deliver as promised to maintain their market reputation, which partially substitutes for formal enforcement when contracts are incomplete. TCE thus suggests that multi-party contracts will be designed either as **relational contracts** (if the relationship is ongoing and valuable) or with built-in enforcement and monitoring provisions if one-shot, to prevent any party from exploiting the others. Empirical support for TCE in this context is seen in the prevalence of **special purpose entities (SPEs)** in project finance – an SPE legally isolates the project and contractually binds parties to specific roles, making the governance of cash flows and decisions transparent and agreed upfront (thereby limiting scope for opportunistic behavior like asset substitution or claim dilution). 

**Agency Problems and Moral Hazard:** In risk-sharing arrangements with asymmetric information, **agency theory** examines how contracts can align incentives. A classic problem is between investors (principals) and the project developer or originator (agent). Once the developer has secured funding through presales or credit pooling, they may have reduced incentive to exert high effort or may take excessive risks, since some downside is borne by the buyers or creditors. This *moral hazard* is evident in real estate presales: developers receiving substantial upfront payments could cut corners in construction quality or delay the project, knowing that buyers are locked in. Buyers anticipate this, so theory predicts presale units will sell at a **discount** relative to completed units, compensating buyers for the developer’s potential moral hazard ([[PDF] Agency problems in indirect real estate investing Abstract](https://www.prres.org/uploads/829/1424/Cieleback_Agency_Problems_In-Indirect.pdf#:~:text=Abstract%20www,adverse%20selection%20and%20moral%20hazard)) ([Key Considerations When Buying a Pre-Construction Home](https://www.mortgagesandbox.com/news/key-considerations-when-buying-a-pre-construction-home#:~:text=Key%20Considerations%20When%20Buying%20a,discounted%29%20price%20when)). Indeed, evidence shows presale properties tend to be cheaper than equivalent completed properties, reflecting the risk that the delivered product may not match promises (quality or timing) – essentially a price adjustment for trust. As one study notes, *“pre-sale agreements generally shift risks from developers to the homebuyer. That is why pre-sales sell for a discounted price”*, due to buyer concerns about completion and quality risk (a direct outcome of moral hazard) ([Risks in Buying Presales People Don't Talk About...](https://happyhomesvancouver.com/blog.html/risks-in-buying-presales-people-dont-talk-about-8103821#:~:text=About,buying%20the%20home%20%E2%80%9C)). 

Another multi-party agency issue arises in **securitization and credit pooling**: the **originate-to-distribute model** prior to the 2008 crisis showed that lenders selling off loans have weaker incentives to rigorously screen borrowers, since defaults would be borne by downstream investors. As the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission found, mortgage originators who could quickly sell loans *effectively passed along default risk* to MBS investors, and this led to lax underwriting and lower credit standards ([Microsoft Word - Current body text without figures and tables.docx](https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/cfr/bank-research-conference/annual-18th/21-furfine.pdf#:~:text=implementation%20of%20risk,rules%20have%20made%20securitized%20loans)). In other words, pooling and tranching succeeded in dispersing risk, but also **created moral hazard for originators**. The theoretical trade-off here is well-known: *risk-sharing vs. incentive alignment*. While pooling risk is beneficial for diversification, removing all risk from the originator (agent) can induce careless behavior. **Holmström’s (1979)** moral hazard framework would suggest keeping some “skin in the game” for the agent to maintain effort. This insight has influenced practice – for example, requiring issuers to retain a small subordinated tranche in securitizations (so they suffer losses if the pool performs poorly) is an incentive mechanism (discussed in Section 4).

Multi-party contracts can also suffer **adverse selection** before they are formed: if one party has private information (e.g. a developer knows the project has hidden issues, or a borrower knows their true default risk), they may still find financing by pooling with others, which could drag down overall quality. Mechanisms like screening, due diligence, and covenants are used to counteract this. *Signaling* can occur too – for instance, a high-quality developer might voluntarily offer stronger guarantees or put more equity into the project to signal confidence, thereby attracting buyers/investors. 

**Commitment Mechanisms:** To combat these agency problems, various commitment and safeguard mechanisms are built into contracts:

- **Collateral and Guarantees:** By pledging collateral or obtaining performance bonds, the agent signals commitment. In construction and project development, a **performance bond** is often required – it *“provides a guarantee to the project owner that the contractor will perform the work as per contract, acting as insurance against contractor default”* ([A Deep Dive into Payment and Performance Bonds in Construction - Bonding Solutions](https://bondingsolutions.com/payment-and-performance-bonds-in-construction/#:~:text=Performance%20bonds%2C%20on%20the%20other,failure%20to%20deliver%20as%20promised)). If the developer fails to deliver, the bond (backed by a surety) compensates the buyers or finances completion. This assures buyers/investors that the developer has something significant at stake, reducing moral hazard.

- **Escrow/Trust Accounts:** Funds paid by buyers (or drawn from lenders) are frequently placed in escrow accounts overseen by fiduciary agents. For example, **Dubai’s off-plan sales law** mandates that *“amounts paid by purchasers [be] deposited into an escrow account with an accredited escrow agent”* ([Off-plan sales: risks and rewards – Afridi & Angell](https://afridi-angell.com/off-plan-sales-risks-and-rewards/#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20the%20trust%20account%20law,The%20amounts%20deposited)), and released only for construction expenses. This prevents the developer from misusing advance payments and ensures money is available to refund buyers or finish the project if the developer fails. Such *fiduciary arrangements* align with TCE’s notion of using a trusted third party to reduce cheating.

- **Staging and Covenants:** Multi-party financing deals include covenants that require the developer to meet certain milestones (regulatory approvals, % of construction completed, minimum presales achieved) before accessing the next tranche of funds. These staging provisions act as *commitment devices*: the developer must continually prove project progress, which is observable, to keep funding flowing. If they underperform, investors can cut losses early.

- **Equity Participation (Risk Retention):** Ensuring the originating party retains a stake is a powerful way to align incentives. In presales, developers usually keep an equity interest in the project (their profit margin is realized only if the project succeeds and sells out). In securitization, regulations now often require sponsors to retain at least 5% of the credit risk (an equity tranche), forcing them to bear some losses and thus carefully monitor asset quality ([Microsoft Word - Current body text without figures and tables.docx](https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/cfr/bank-research-conference/annual-18th/21-furfine.pdf#:~:text=The%20Dodd,being%20issued%20with%20markedly%20higher)). The theory behind this is straightforward principal-agent alignment: when the agent’s payoff is tied to project outcomes, they act more diligently, mitigating moral hazard.

In summary, theoretical models stress that without proper incentive alignment, the very mechanisms that enable risk sharing (prepaid contracts, pooling) can encourage opportunistic behavior. The literature on **agency and information asymmetry** in these contexts yields a clear lesson: *effective contract design must balance risk allocation with incentive compatibility*. This often means not all risk can be transferred – some must be borne by those in control to motivate them. Modern structured contracts are thus hybrids: they spread risk but also include retention pieces, monitoring, and legal safeguards to keep each party’s incentives in check ([Microsoft Word - Current body text without figures and tables.docx](https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/cfr/bank-research-conference/annual-18th/21-furfine.pdf#:~:text=rates%2C%20yet%20notably%20lower%20loan,also%20seemed%20to%20accelerate%20the)) ([](https://josephmahoney.web.illinois.edu/BA549_Fall%202010/Session%203/Williamson%20(1979).pdf#:~:text=subgoal%20pursuit,what%20is%20involved%20in%20idiosyncratic)).

## 4. Comparative Analysis of Regulatory Approaches

Because of the complex risks and agency issues involved in pre-financed projects and structured finance, regulatory frameworks have evolved to protect participants and ensure market stability. Different jurisdictions and sectors have adopted a variety of approaches, ranging from contract law provisions to specialized financial regulations. This section compares some notable regulatory and institutional frameworks governing **pre-sale financing and structured credit**, and their impact on contractual governance and investor protection.

**Real Estate Pre-Financing Regulations:** In real estate (a primary example of future goods sales), jurisdictions differ widely in how they protect buyers and encourage development:

- **Common Law and Statutory Protections:** In many countries, general contract and property law provide the baseline (e.g. classifying presales as executory contracts as per Sale of Goods Acts). Some jurisdictions add specific protections. For instance, **UAE (Dubai)** implemented robust measures after experiencing off-plan market volatility. Dubai’s **Interim Real Estate Register law (Law 13 of 2008)** requires all off-plan sales to be registered, or else they are void ([Off-plan sales: risks and rewards – Afridi & Angell](https://afridi-angell.com/off-plan-sales-risks-and-rewards/#:~:text=The%20interim%20registration%20law%20,is%20considered%20null%20and%20void)). Furthermore, **Dubai’s Trust Account Law (Law 8 of 2007)** obligates developers to *register and to deposit all purchaser payments into a special escrow account*, managed by an approved escrow agent, to be used only for that project’s construction ([Off-plan sales: risks and rewards – Afridi & Angell](https://afridi-angell.com/off-plan-sales-risks-and-rewards/#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20the%20trust%20account%20law,The%20amounts%20deposited)). This effectively ring-fences buyer funds for the project, preventing misappropriation and ensuring that if a project is cancelled, remaining funds can be returned. It also stipulates how much money developers can keep if a buyer defaults, typically linked to construction progress ([Off-plan sales: risks and rewards – Afridi & Angell](https://afridi-angell.com/off-plan-sales-risks-and-rewards/#:~:text=The%20interim%20registration%20law%20,plan%20unit%20as%20follows)). These regulations have become a model for protecting off-plan buyers by **shifting some risk back to developers via legal mandate** – developers cannot access buyer money until they deliver milestones, and they carry the obligation to refund in case of non-completion.

- **Emerging Markets and Consumer Protection:** In markets like **Brazil**, where presales are common, legal innovations have also occurred. Brazil introduced the concept of *patrimônio de afetação* (asset segregation) in the early 2000s: developers can opt to segregate a project’s assets and revenues from their general estate, creating a dedicated pool that guarantees project completion and secures buyer claims. Additionally, court decisions (supported by consumer protection codes) now ensure buyers can get most of their money back if a contract is rescinded by either party ([Microsoft Word - Real Estate Eng v4.doc](https://www.realoptions.org/papers2008/Brandao%20Luiz%20-%20Real%20Estate%20Brazil%20V1.pdf#:~:text=market%20conditions%20become%20unfavorable,out%20of%20the%20sales%20contract)). Such measures were reactions to past abuses where developers might cancel projects and attempt to keep payments. By legally ensuring buyers have a priority claim or refund right, the **regulatory approach forces a more equitable risk-sharing** – developers retain more risk, incentivizing them to complete projects or face financial penalties. On the other hand, these rules also impose discipline on buyers (who lose a percentage if they back out without cause), aiming to discourage speculative default.

- **Developed Economies:** In the US, presale of real estate (e.g. condominiums) is typically governed by state laws requiring escrow of deposits and full disclosure (e.g. under Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act historically). Many states mandate that **buyer deposits in new developments be held in escrow until closing or bonded** to protect buyers if the developer fails. Similarly, in *Europe*, some countries require bank guarantees for any payments made before a property is delivered (e.g. Spain’s Law 57/1968 required developers to secure buyer down payments via insurance or guarantee). These regulatory tools reduce buyers’ exposure to developer default, essentially *assigning financial institutions as risk-bearers/guarantors* unless the developer delivers.

- **Case Comparison:** A comparative case study is **Hong Kong vs. Mainland China** in presale regulation. Hong Kong, with a long history of presales, uses a “Consent Scheme” that requires developers to show financial capability and reach certain construction stages before selling units ([](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2017/preliminary/paper/3HAfnhnK#:~:text=and%20Fang%202012%29,modeling%20concerning%20a%20presale%20contract)) ([](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2017/preliminary/paper/3HAfnhnK#:~:text=market%20suffers%20from%20heavy%20regulations,the%20Consent%20Scheme%20projects%20to)). Mainland China, for many years, allowed earlier presales with less stringent requirements, which, as studies like Deng and Liu (2009) note, led to faster development but also more risk transferred to buyers. In fact, an NBER study (“Haste or Waste? The Role of Presale in China”) finds that *China’s lenient presale model shifted risk heavily onto homebuyers*, contributing to speculative supply and volatility ([[PDF] Haste or Waste? The Role of Presale in Residential Housing](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w32013/w32013.pdf#:~:text=Housing%20www,the%20relatively%20lenient%20regulations)). In response, China has since tightened rules (e.g. requiring developers to have progressed a certain percentage in construction and to use presale proceeds only for that project). These examples illustrate that **regulatory strictness is inversely related to buyer risk**: where regulation is lenient, buyers demand higher risk premiums (lower prices, etc.) and the system relies on market discipline; where regulation is strict, it enforces risk-sharing ex ante, ideally preventing severe outcomes like project failures or runaway speculation.

**Structured Finance and Banking Regulations:** On the credit pooling side, regulators have focused on **financial stability and investor protection**:

- **Bank Capital Regulations (Basel Accords):** The Basel I (1988) accord was relatively simple but by Basel II (2004), regulators introduced explicit capital charges for securitization exposures. Banks were required to hold capital against off-balance-sheet risks, with formulas often tied to credit ratings of tranches (the Ratings-Based Approach). After the 2008 crisis, Basel III substantially revised these rules, recognizing that some capital charges were insufficient. **Basel III’s revised securitization framework (2017)** increased risk weights, especially for lower tranches and resecuritizations, and added factors like tranche maturity and thickness to better capture risk ([Revisions to the securitisation framework - Basel III document](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d374.pdf#:~:text=SEC,the%20Basel%20II%20RBA%2C%20namely)) ([Revisions to the securitisation framework - Basel III document](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d374.pdf#:~:text=performed%20by%20the%20Committee%20suggests,as%20reflected%20in)). The intent was to make securitizations more robust by forcing banks to hold more capital (i.e. absorb more risk) for complex structures, thus discouraging extreme risk transfer that leaves them with too little skin in the game. Industry groups like SIFMA have criticized some of these changes as *“punitive…resulting in more capital for securitized assets than if the loans were held on balance sheet”*, potentially raising the cost of credit ([

              ](https://www.sifma.org/resources/news/how-the-basel-iii-endgame-could-impair-securitization-markets-and-harm-us-businesses-and-consumers/#:~:text=Securitization%20allows%20banks%20and%20other,Securitization%20products%20are%20also)). From a theoretical perspective, this is regulators correcting a market failure: *unpriced systemic risk*. By upping capital, they ensure banks remain partly liable for pooled credit risk, aligning with the notion that complete risk offloading can create systemic moral hazard.

- **Risk Retention (“Skin in the Game”):** Both the US and EU implemented direct regulations to align incentives in securitization. The **Dodd-Frank Act (2010)** in the US mandates that securitization sponsors retain at least 5% of the credit risk of the assets they securitize ([Microsoft Word - Current body text without figures and tables.docx](https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/cfr/bank-research-conference/annual-18th/21-furfine.pdf#:~:text=The%20Dodd,being%20issued%20with%20markedly%20higher)). Similarly, the EU’s CRR has retention rules. These rules operationalize a simple agency theory solution: if originators hold a piece, they are less likely to stuff the pool with bad loans. Research by Furfine (2018) finds that post-implementation, mortgage loans subject to risk retention had lower loan-to-value ratios and default rates, suggesting **retention rules made securitized loans safer, though at the cost of slightly higher interest rates** ([Microsoft Word - Current body text without figures and tables.docx](https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/cfr/bank-research-conference/annual-18th/21-furfine.pdf#:~:text=loans.%20Using%20a%20difference,evidence%20suggests%20that%20the%20risk)) ([Microsoft Word - Current body text without figures and tables.docx](https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/cfr/bank-research-conference/annual-18th/21-furfine.pdf#:~:text=three%20times%20that%20of%20before%2C,less%20likely%20to%20become%20troubled)). Thus, regulation enforced a bit of risk-sharing (between originators and investors) that the market may not have achieved on its own, reducing moral hazard.

- **Investor Protection and Market Conduct:** Regulatory agencies also impose disclosure and oversight requirements. For example, the U.S. SEC requires extensive prospectus disclosure for asset-backed securities (so investors can assess pool quality), and in the EU, the Simple, Transparent, and Comparable (STC) securitization criteria aim to standardize deal features. These efforts reflect the idea that *reducing information asymmetry* (a key theoretical friction) will improve market outcomes – better-informed investors can price risk more accurately, which in turn disciplines issuers.

- **Public vs. Private Risk Allocation:** In infrastructure finance, governments sometimes step in as *risk absorbers* through guarantees or subsidies, effectively acting as a backstop to credit pools. Conversely, some regulations limit public exposure – for instance, rules that forbid government bailouts of failed projects, to ensure that private lenders bear the consequences (avoiding moral hazard of an implicit government guarantee). The **Basel framework** even gives special treatment to certain project finance exposures (under the slotting approach or specialized lending rules), acknowledging that high-quality project finance can have lower defaults due to structural enhancements. 

**Impact on Contractual Governance:** Regulations often hard-wire certain governance practices into contracts. For example, to qualify for lower capital charges or investor acceptance, securitization deals now routinely include **independent trustees, periodic reporting, and triggers that protect senior investors** (like diverting cash to senior notes if performance deteriorates). These features, encouraged by rating agency criteria and laws, mirror the theoretical best practices for multi-party governance (transparency, third-party oversight, defined contingent control rights). In real estate, laws requiring escrow accounts or guarantees effectively insert a third-party guarantor into the buyer-developer relationship, transforming a simple bilateral contract into a more secure tri-party arrangement. Thus, regulatory frameworks across jurisdictions tend to reinforce the lessons of theory: *they mandate risk-sharing arrangements that private contracts might otherwise neglect due to incentive problems*. The outcome is more robust contractual arrangements that can attract broad participation (e.g. small investors will buy MBS if they know regulations forced the issuer to disclose and retain risk; homebuyers will consider presales if laws safeguard their deposits).

**Case Studies:** A noteworthy case is the **Global Financial Crisis of 2007-08**, often cited as evidence that improper risk distribution (too much risk pushed onto uninformed investors) and lack of oversight can be catastrophic. In its wake, virtually all regulators tightened rules on structured products – an example of regulatory convergence to enforce prudent risk-sharing (through retention and capital buffers) and better alignment of incentives (through accountability and transparency). On the other hand, a positive case is the **success of project finance in emerging markets** when supported by strong contractual frameworks and institutions. The literature (e.g. Benjamin Esty’s studies) shows that projects with well-structured contracts and appropriate risk allocation (and often multilateral agency involvement or guarantees) have had high completion rates and attracted capital at reasonable costs, whereas projects without such support faced premium costs or failure. This underscores that *good risk-sharing design, often aided by regulatory standards or public institutions, improves credit outcomes*.

## Conclusion

In summary, the theoretical and empirical literature paints a cohesive picture of transactions involving future goods sales and pooled credit structures. **Contractual arrangements for future goods** (from real estate presales to infrastructure offtake agreements) are fundamentally about distributing risk across time and participants – they allow capital to be raised today by allocating uncertain future outcomes between buyers and sellers ([Sale before Completion of Development: Pricing and Strategy | Request PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4995300_Sale_before_Completion_of_Development_Pricing_and_Strategy#:~:text=The%20paper%20examines%20the%20risk,nature%20and%20dominated%20by%20large)) ([Microsoft Word - Real Estate Eng v4.doc](https://www.realoptions.org/papers2008/Brandao%20Luiz%20-%20Real%20Estate%20Brazil%20V1.pdf#:~:text=presale,price%20during%20the%20construction%20phase)). The success of these arrangements depends on mitigating the inherent agency and information problems through clever contract design (deposits, options, collateral, etc.) and often through regulation. **Credit pooling mechanisms** (syndicates, MBS, CDOs, etc.) enable larger risk-sharing, tapping broader funding sources and theoretically lowering default risk via diversification ([The Pooling and Tranching of Securities: A Model of Informed ... - jstor](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3598066#:~:text=The%20Pooling%20and%20Tranching%20of,free%20debt%20contract)) ([Things to do: ](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/conference/2005/financial_intermed/ivashina.pdf#:~:text=In%20simple%20terms%2C%20syndication%20is,practice%20used%20in%20security%20underwriting)), but they too require alignment of incentives for screening and monitoring. 

The **dynamics of multi-party contracts** are governed by principles from transaction cost economics and agency theory – namely, that without trust and verifiable commitments, parties will demand safeguards or price discounts to compensate for risk of opportunism ([](https://josephmahoney.web.illinois.edu/BA549_Fall%202010/Session%203/Williamson%20(1979).pdf#:~:text=subgoal%20pursuit,what%20is%20involved%20in%20idiosyncratic)) ([Risks in Buying Presales People Don't Talk About...](https://happyhomesvancouver.com/blog.html/risks-in-buying-presales-people-dont-talk-about-8103821#:~:text=About,buying%20the%20home%20%E2%80%9C)). Thus, many frameworks incorporate third-party monitors, retention of risk, or reputation mechanisms to keep everyone honest. Finally, **regulatory frameworks** play a pivotal role in standardizing and enforcing these risk-sharing arrangements, ensuring a baseline of fairness and stability (whether through escrow protections in real estate or capital/risk-retention rules in finance) ([Off-plan sales: risks and rewards – Afridi & Angell](https://afridi-angell.com/off-plan-sales-risks-and-rewards/#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20the%20trust%20account%20law,The%20amounts%20deposited)) ([Microsoft Word - Current body text without figures and tables.docx](https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/cfr/bank-research-conference/annual-18th/21-furfine.pdf#:~:text=The%20Dodd,being%20issued%20with%20markedly%20higher)). 

Notably, theories and models initially developed for general markets (e.g. Arrow’s risk allocation, Jensen & Meckling’s agency theory, Williamson’s contracting paradigms) find very concrete applications in the **real estate development process** – an area where huge upfront investments, long horizons, and uncertainty make contractual risk-sharing indispensable. By applying these frameworks, developers and financiers have devised contracts that allow projects to proceed that otherwise would be impossible to finance. The literature, old and new, reinforces that **well-structured contracts and pooled financing can create positive-sum games**, enabling growth while dividing risks in acceptable ways, so long as information and incentive problems are kept in check by design. The continued evolution of theory-informed regulation and innovative contracting suggests that these mechanisms will remain central, adapting to new forms of “future goods” (from infrastructure to technology projects) and new kinds of credit pooling (such as fintech crowdfunding), always with the same core challenge: balancing risk-sharing with reliable performance.
